Emerge from the dark smoke of battle as a new vision of the master spy.

;ASH KOGA SKIN BUNDLE
Become Ash Koga, with this striking skin bundle. Includes the Ash Koga Warframe Skin and the Nikana Ryu Skin.

'''Ash Revisited'''

'''We decided to rework Blade Storm after almost a full year of the same themed feedback showing up. We often heard and experienced a power that doesn't allow for player participation beyond pressing 4 once and waiting. We have been increasingly committed to participatory powers (especially ultimates) and focused on emphasizing that for Blade Storm.'''

[https://forums.warframe.com/topic/725161-ash-revisited-feedback-megathread/ Ash Revisited Feedback Megathread]

'''Blade Storm Changes:'''
*Blade Storm now has a new 'Mark Enemy' mode that is activated when you hit 4. Ash enters target mode, which you can freely target enemies with your reticule up to 3 times each for attack. Once you're satisfied, press 4 again, Blade Storm begins and all targeted enemies are attacked!
*Each mark costs Energy (15) which is affected by Mods. If a marked enemy is killed by a squad mate, you will get the energy back. 
*Marks made while invisible by any source will have a cheaper base cost (10). 
*Enemies killed by Blade Storm will dissolve, leaving no corpse behind to detect!

'''Teleport Changes:'''
*Teleport will now allow you to target anything with a health bar! Instead of being limited to Teleporting to allies or enemies, you can now teleport to objects. 

'''Smoke Screen Changes:'''
*Smoke Screen can now be cast while running (no lower body movement lock).
*Smoke Screen can now be cast while in-air! 

'''Please note that we will be closely monitoring your practical feedback - please feel free to share videos and discussions after playing this rework. It'll help us if you include details on your build used too.'''

Please note regarding these changes that we took the large 2000 Endo chances and chopped/reassigned to give a more diverse set of options to have variety of other rewards. We are aiming to make the full drop table more broadly appealing. When The War Within launched, we added Rivens to Sorties as a common drop to be the new, interesting, and unique evergreen goal for players in Sorties.  Rivens remain common with these changes as we see them as the ultimate goal for Sorties. Regarding Nitain specifically, the majority of our recently active players have less than 9 Nitain in their accounts and there is considerable interest in some new ways to acquire, so we are trying out Sorties as an option. A next step here is being considered to add a completely new Ayatan in the place of 2K Endo to give collectors and Endo hunters something to look forward to.

As we continue together down the path of Riven Mods, it’s expected that twists and turns will arise that require a shift in the original route. With your Community feedback we bring you another iteration of the Riven Mod system! Our intentions to have Riven Mods bring new life to older content still remains, and we thank you for your continued feedback. The following Riven changes have been made: 
*Riven Disposition (Faint, Neutral, and Strong) has been added! Riven Disposition is the way in which power level of Mods is attuned to the weapon it is generated for. You can expect to see more powerful Rivens for less used weapons and vice versa.
*Existing Rivens have been automatically rebalanced to fit this Riven Disposition
*When Cycling a Riven with Kuva, you can now choose to "Accept" or "Decline" a Cycle result using the arrow and Confirm button presented.
*You will only have to Unveil a Riven Mod one time: on first discovery. Cycling no longer Veils Riven Mods. '''&#42;A script has been run to unveil Veiled Riven Mods that have been Cycled. Relog required.'''
*Adjusted Endo return when dissolving Riven mods:
**+100 Endo for every Mastery Rank requirement above the minimum of 8
**+200 Endo for every Cycle performed on the Mod
*Chat Linked Riven Mods now contain correct challenge progress/requirement info, as well as Cycles.
*Kuva Cycling costs have been reduced significantly. 
*Before:
**Cycle 1: 900
**Cycle 2: 1000
**Cycle 3: 1300
**Cycle 4: 1800
**Cycle 5: 2500
**Cycle 6: 3400
**Cycle 7: 4500
**Cycle 8: 5800
**Cycle 9: 7300
**Cycle 10: 9000
**Continues each Cycle, no cap. 
*After:
**Cycle 1: 900
**Cycle 2: 1000
**Cycle 3: 1200
**Cycle 4: 1400
**Cycle 5: 1700
**Cycle 6: 2000
**Cycle 7: 2350
**Cycle 8: 2750
**Cycle 9: 3200
**Cycle 10: 3600
**Continues each Cycle, no cap. 
*Riven Disposition stats on Rifles will be visible if there's at least one equippable Riven Mod for said Rifle. 
*Tweaked the Cycling diorama to include Samodeus and updated Riven Mod Cycle and transition sounds! 

'''Fixes:'''
*Fixed Veiled Riven Mods unequipping themselves due to not meeting the Mastery Rank requirement. 
*Fixed picking up Reactant as the Operator not counting towards your current Reactant pile.
*Fixed the power menu remaining on the UI when using Transference and playing with a controller.

'''Spoiler Changes & Fixes:'''
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
'''Riven Mod Changes:'''
*Removed the "Kill Sentients without raising alarms" Unveil challenge due to impossibility with the way Lua mission spawning works. Challenge complications will be updated retroactively, in this case, the removed challenge will simply become "Kill Sentients".

*Tweaked and removed some of the more frustrating challenges for Riven Unveliling.
*Fixed heads while aim-gliding challenge for Riven Mods not requiring lethal headshots, they have to be kills now.

'''Fixes:'''
*Fixed Orvius parts being exchanged for Ducats.
*Fixed Kuva Siphons becoming 'frozen' by several Warframe powers, allowing for infinite farming.

'''Open Letter from the Digital Extremes team:'''

&#8216;Finally it's here&#8216; the developers and players said in unison with tears (of joy?) in their eyes! When traditional developers pen their open letters at launch, it's often the last step after months or years of development. It's often a sign-off to address the people who are about to dive into the finished work of a collective group. But Warframe is far from traditional and our work is never done. 

The War Within is here on PC! This is the next chapter in the story of Warframe. What we set out to do always seems a little wild in hindsight, but it's the thrill and ambition of storytelling that drives us to challenge ourselves and you. We want to grow and change Warframe in interesting ways. We're presenting you another chapter of growth today. 

This chapter tells a story of your patience, our gratitude, and of course some wonderful evolution for the game. We're introducing an awe inspiring and dangerous environment: the Kuva Fortress. We're pushing our engine technology to bring you graphic improvements. We're bringing you a story about your past. 

The War Within is also a reflection of lessons for us on how to feed, respect, and tame the growing animal that is Warframe. This update's name has outgrown itself and it represents something bigger. If you asked any of us 4 years ago what we expected to happen with this project, none of us would believe you if you showed us this day. 

We are beyond lucky to have hard working people at Digital Extremes to bring this chapter of Warframe to life. We are grateful to have you to share it with. 

Thank you Tenno. We hope you enjoy another Update that's free from us to you.

'''New Quest: The War Within!'''{{clr}}
The Grineer Empire grows stronger as a cryptic adversary surfaces. What secrets does the Grineer Empire keep? Underpowered, unprepared and forced out of your comfort, you must find it in yourself to improvise, not just to save yourself but the fate of all Tenno. The Queens' Fortress awaits, where both Warframe and Operator will be pushed past their limits as they slowly unravel mysteries about the Tenno’s past and their true capabilities.

The next chapter to 'The Second Dream' has arrived. Knowing what the Tenno are is just the beginning of your story. It is time to face The War Within. 

How to access this Quest: If you've completed the Sedna Junction, you will receive this quest immediately on login via Inbox message.

'''New Tileset: Kuva Fortress!'''{{clr}}
Once you've progressed far enough in The War Within to discover The Kuva Fortress, a new region will appear on your Solar Chart!

Play through and experience some of our most difficult and heavily fortified missions yet. 

With this set, we knew we wanted to provide an awe-inspiring entry into the world of the Grineer Queens and Kuva. This set is complete with the latest in graphics enhancements like Volumetric Lighting, and includes some of the first ever Archwing Enemy incorporation into foot missions. Don't forget to aim up, Tenno. 

New Music can be discovered while playing these missions, Keith Power brings us his creepiest compositions to date!

'''Missions Offered:'''
*'''Assault:''' A completely new spin on the spirit of 'Sabotage'. This is arguably one of our longest non-endless missions to date. This mission also includes classic side-objectives like Cache hunting!
*'''Exterminate:''' An old faithful.
*'''Capture:''' A speed-runner's delight.
*'''Mobile Defense:''' Will it take longer than Lotus calculated?
*'''Spy:''' Ivara, Ivara, let down your Zipline.

'''New Enemies & Grineer 'Kuva Siphon' Missions:'''
[[File:The War Within - New Enemies.png|660px|center]]

'''KUVA GUARDIANS''' - Wearing heavy armor and adorned in red cloth, the Kuva Guardians are among the fighting elite in the Queens' army. The Kuva Guardians will surround you and, with just a few well-placed blows, will bring you to your knees. Defeating them will depend on more than what’s in your Arsenal...

'''KUVA JESTER''' - Beware of these mischievous, Jester-like creatures that are quick to attack and are quite deadly.

'''Grineer &#8216;Kuva Siphon&#8216; Missions:'''{{clr}}
After you complete The War Within, Kuva Siphons may appear on Hard Grineer Environments (Sedna, Kuva Fortress, Uranus). These are side-quests related to the larger goals of the Grineer Empire. You will encounter new enemies here, and be required to use the skills learned in The War Within to prevail.

'''New Weapons:'''
<gallery hideaddbutton="true" widths="660" captionposition="within">
The War Within - Highlights
</gallery>

'''Twin Rogga''' - These twin barrels of destruction are the signature pistols of the Kuva Guardians. 

'''Kesheg''' - Slice through mobs of unruly enemies with this fierce halberd, the signature weapon of the Kuva Guardians. 

Fourth and fifth weapons exist… but defeating The War Within will be necessary to discover them.

'''New Cosmetics:'''{{clr}}
*Kuva Kavat Armor - This decorative armor was forged for the Grineer Queens’ royal Kavats.
*Kuva Kubrow Armor - Drahks are outfitted with this armor for the Queens’ royal prisoner hunts.
*Landing Craft Kuva Skins - A Kuva themed skin for your Landing Craft.
*Kuva Cloak - Once worn by an elegant Elder Queen, before time and disease left her body mangled and disfigured.
*Kuva Braid - Symbolizing the corrupting power of the Grineer Queens.
*Kuva Armor Collection - A full set of Kuva Armor.
*Continuity Collection - Become Grineer royalty with this complete set of Kuva weapons and armor.

'''General Additions:'''
*Frost & Frost Prime now have cloth physics! For years our favourite Master of Ice has had a rather static cloak, but no more! 
*Solo Mode missions now start after just 5 seconds! 
*Decorator Mode is now here for Dojos and Landing Crafts! This mode allows you to access a special menu where you can continuously change the items in your Landing Craft or Dojo. All the hassle of returning to the menu over and over for each placement are gone. 
*Available daily Maroo and weekly Clem missions have been added to the World State Window under Alerts! 
*A Mastery Rank 23 test has been added! The War Within introduces enough content to push long-term players that are currently Mastery Rank 22 into Mastery Rank 23!

*A more robust Display Options menu is here! You can now disable or enable more Graphics Quality options!

'''Faction Invasion Changes:'''{{clr}}
Ever since the change to the new Solar Chart in Specters of the Rail, the Invasion system hasn't exactly been exciting or novel. The War Within brings some much needed freshness to this part of the game!

As part of an effort to both repair and refresh the Invasion system, the following changes and additions have been made:
*Prior Sortie Season Vandal and Wraith rewards can now be offered as invasion rewards by the respective faction. 
*Interception missions have been added into the mix when playing for invading faction.
*Winning factions will now 'Occupy' the node for up to 24 hours. During this period, the invaders will raid the location for resources towards a mysterious 'Construction Project'
*The mission type at a particular Invasion node will change every 15 minutes.
*The progress of an invasion can now lead to a Faction Specific event! Watch closely as the Grineer and Corpus gather enough strength!
*Factions now pay an additional 1000 Credits each time you run a mission for them on the same node (up to max of 10K).
*Fixed issues with Invasion missions loading to black and no spawning enemies. 
*Fixed Invasion progress not counting if a player was in mission during a Hotfix. 
*Fixed Phorid occupied nodes still showing the underlying bosses. 

'''Sortie Changes & Additions:'''{{clr}}
Sorties were introduced in The Second Dream. They originally launched with 'Seasons' that rotated with set rewards. Since launch we iterated in several ways, including adding repeatable/non-repeatable rewards and more. Now we bring you more change with The War Within: Sortie Seasons are no more. We now have a set reward list of rewards that are always repeatable. 
*The new pre-requisite to access Sorties is completion of The War Within. 
*Nezha Parts have moved to the Tenno Lab in player Dojos. 
*Vandal and Wraith weapon parts have moved to the Invasion System as rewards for their respective factions. 
*Sortie Rewards are now set as:
**Various Endo Amounts
**Orokin Catalyst
**Orokin Reactor
**Exilus Adapter
**A random Focus Lens
**Legendary Core
**1 new item coming soon (see below)!
*There is a new addition to Sortie rewards, but this will be revealed upon completion of The War Within.

'''Endless Void Fissure Missions Changes & Additions:'''{{clr}}
Interception, Defense, Survival, and Excavation Endless Void Fissure Missions have been revamped and now function in a new way! 

First, every reward interval can have it's own Relic selected and opened (if you get enough Reactant per interval). 

Secondly, the reward intervals are as follows (for clarity):

Defense: 5 Waves.{{clr}}
Interception: 1 Round.{{clr}}
Survival: 5 Minutes.{{clr}}
Excavation: 200 Cryotic. {{clr}}

Should you collect the necessary Reactant per interval and open your Relic, a bonus will occur and you will be allowed to re-select a new Relic for the next interval! The bonuses are as follows:
*Every time you open a Relic, you get a pre-determined booster. These boosters stack the longer you stay.  
*The first interval: 1.25x Affinity.
*The second interval: 1.25x Credits.
*The third interval: 1.25x Resources.
*The fourth interval: 1.25x Resource Drop Rate. 
*The fifth interval: a random Exceptional Relic (that can be used in the same mission). 
*The sixth interval: 1.5x Affinity (replaces first).
*The seventh interval: 1.5x Credits (replaces second).
*The eighth interval: 1.5x Resources (replaces third).
*The ninth interval: 1.5x Resource Drop Rate (replaces fourth).
*The tenth interval: a higher tier random Flawless Relic (that can be used in the same mission). 
*Once you get to the fifteenth interval, you'll receive a random Radiant Relic (that can be used in the same mission. 
*Boosters continue to increase every set of intervals and are capped at double (2x).
*Radiants on every fifth interval past the fifteenth. 
*Every Relic opened will result in Traces!

'''Capture Mission Changes:'''{{clr}}
Capture enemy types are now split into 3 tiers- Easy (1-10), Medium (10-20), Hard (20+).

Corpus Nullifiers and white-suited Corpus Targets (capable of creating a Snow Globe-esqe barrier) no longer appear on lower level Capture missions.

'''Holster Customization Changes:'''{{clr}}
*Changed "X Offset" option to adjust Holster Position to move along to edge of your Warframe.
*Added "Attach Part" option to select specific areas to Holster. Standard Holsters also have this option.
*Added "Z Offset" option to adjust Holster Position distance from your Warframe.

'''General Graphics Improvements & Volumetric Lighting:'''{{clr}}
Volumetric Lighting technology is here and has been implemented in The War Within quest!
We've also improved player lighting and added various weather effects to the game. 

Archwing Movement Collision Improvements:

Improvements on collisions, and clipping on all Archwings have been made across the board!

'''Conclave Additions:'''
*Grineer Fortress ‘Bunkers’ Conclave Map has been added for Team Annihilation and Annihilation! Take control of the security systems and turrets scattered throughout this Map and use them against other players. Take note: other players aren’t the only thing you have to worry about.
*Arbiters of Hexis ‘Arbiter's Arena’ Lunaro Map has been added! The Arbiters of Hexis know there is more to the Tenno than just being good Warriors – they know them to be excellent Lunaro players as well! Seek truth through discipline and practice on this new Arbiters of Hexis themed Lunaro map. The perpendicular goals will require skill, precision, and teamwork to overcome. Bring your passion to the sands of this Lunaro map today!

You can now replay the Second Dream quest! You’ll notice some small tweaks upon replaying it, such as not receiving a Focus lens, and not being able to select a new Focus school upon completion (Naramon for life, amirite?). More quests will get the same treatment down the line, but for now the ability to replay the Second Dream is meant to get us all prepared and up to speed for The War Within (and to feel the feels again).

;Dedicated Servers!
It’s finally here- dedicated servers for Lunaro and Conclave modes! This update brings the first iteration of our dedicated server plans, with more additions to come down the road.

To host a dedicated server, click Settings (the gear cog) in your Launcher and select ‘Start Server’. This will give you the option on which game mode to host, a ‘Clan only’ hosting option, and to insert a custom MOTD.

We’ve also introduced dedicated server leaderboards! Your score accumulates the longer you have active players on your server, and can be viewed under Profile > Leaderboards. While the first iteration is limited to just these Karma points, we want to highlight players who are actively helping to improve the Conclave experience for their fellow Tenno. Future updates will flesh out and expand upon this feature to better support these Dedicated Server Champions!

&#42;'''Note from your Developers:''' It’s been 3 years of Carrier dominating the Vacuum business, and only recently we've even started a dialog on a topic you've brought up frequently. Experiments (such as The Vacuum Within) typically have 2 sides- you either fail or you succeed. Our previous idea to have universal Vacuum be a 3 Mod makeup was proposed on Devstream #80, to which we then scrapped after acknowledging the copious amounts of “please don’t do that” feedback.

From that, our new idea was to have Vacuum built into every Sentinel with a reduced range. Upon reading the constructive feedback from our Community about The Vacuum Within, it was clear we needed to make some tweaks- and here we have experimental Mutation X! '''<u>Vacuum is now an equippable Mod (Precept) for all Sentinels. We have also increased the range from 6m to 12m at max rank.</u>''' All current Sentinel owners will receive this Mod instantly, as well as retroactively with every Sentinel crafted or purchased- much like other default Precepts.

With that being said, we appreciate those that kept the feedback valuable and refrained from death threats. We changed something precious to you, and we will continue to change where needed as we listen to the Community.

*Changed the Mod image for Ammo Case to better reflect its role. 
*Compacted large numbers for some ability notifications on the HUD (eg: Equinox’s Maim).

*Fixed Oxium Ospreys suicide charging immediately.
*Fixed being able to place decorations in the Operator room in areas you should not be able to.
*Fixed Ammo Case still applying its buffs after Carrier has died.
*Fixed Ammo Case refilling ammo on respawn.
*Fixed Ammo Case refilling ammo on Host Migration.

;All Sentinels now have a passive 6 meter Loot Vacuum, no Mods required!

This particular Update note is going to be a bit of a read, so get ready!

It’s been a long time coming and a highly request change! If you hadn’t guessed it already, Carrier usage represents almost 80% of the total used Sentinels, and considering we have more than 5 unique choices this needed balancing. Today we're eager to introduce a community driven experiment within the Sentinel class. This is not the final book in this conversation, just the beginning.

We've also mentioned [[Kubrow]]/[[Kavat]] are not off the table. What we want to do is measure. We know where Carrier sits in usage compared to the rest of the options. We want a calculated release of a change that will deliver on giving Sentinels the function of Vacuum, and see how it affects the usage of content in that category. The results are something we'll be sharing as it should be very interesting to everyone invested in this particular topic. The shovel in the ground on this will apply to Sentinels first, but Pets aren't off the table.

We're starting with Sentinels to have this contained group of content analyzed. We will be keeping a close eye on how all of you feel about the new vacuum as well as looking at metrics to see how the distribution of sentinel usage changes across the community (right now 80% of you use Carrier)! We will share results along the way as a team, as soon as this Friday on Devstream #81!

*Carrier’s precept has been automatically changed to [[Ammo Case]] - now increases ammunition capacity and converts ammo pickups into ammo for the currently equipped weapon after a short delay.

'''Tenno Reinforcement:'''
<gallery hideaddbutton="true" widths="640" captionposition="within">
The Vacuum Within - Teaser
</gallery>

*'''[[Gazal Machete]]''' - Each kill with this swooping blade adds bonus corrosive damage to the Djinn Sentinel’s next Fatal Attraction cast. In turn, each Fatal Attraction cast by the sentinel bestows the weapon with a period of corrosive damage.

Research it in the Tenno Lab or find it in the Market today!

|additions      =
'''[[Djinn Gazal Skin]]''' - Wrapped in silk and etched with glowing designs, the Gazal offers a glimpse of the Djinn uncorrupted by Infestation.

'''[[Gazal Complete Collection]]''' - An entire set of Gazal armor.

*You can now place Resource decorations in your Landing Craft! Check out the Landing Craft section in the Market.

|fixes          =

*Fixed Sortie Defense agents would get stuck in a reload loop.
*Fixed missions not being automatically selected when clicking on an Invasion with only one active battle.

;Ayatan Treasures are here!
Ayatan Treasures will let you become a procurer, collector, and trader of ornate Orokin artifacts. Hunt them like Indiana Jones via special missions given to you by Maroo, or find them during your regular excursions.

There are two new terms to familiarize yourself with: Sculptures and Stars.
The individual Sculptures and Stars have several variations of rarity and value. Sculptures, which are more valuable, can be completed by socketing in the appropriate types of Stars.

Maroo will pay handsomely in Endo for your Ayatan treasures, but she’ll offer more for completed Sculptures. You’ll have to decide whether you want a quick payout or wait for the big prize and complete your Sculpture. If Endo isn’t what you desire most, you can keep your collection on display in your Landing Craft or trade your treasures with other Tenno.

Finding Ayatan treasures in regular missions will be rare, but if you’re feeling adventurous, you can speak with Maroo for a special weekly treasure hunt mission that will test your coordination, speed, and mobility. If you enjoy the more leisurely approach to art collecting, you can always have other Tenno do the work for you and acquire your treasure through the trade system. Whatever your method of procurement, once you have a piece of Ayatan treasure, what you do with it will be up to you.

;Resource Caches/Crates!
Harvest and collect Resources from the world around you! Enemies, lockers and crates will continue to drop Resources, and now you can collect additional Resources by harvesting from the new Resource Caches. All default 'Resource cakes' have been replaced with actual representations of the Resources you're picking up!

;Manduka Operator Suit
Pick up the latest in Operator attire. The Manduka Outfit is now available!


*The Void is now an eligible region for Alerts! Alerts that occur in the Void will have a chance to include Void Traces as a reward!
*Endo rewards in Alerts now scale to enemy level, with values of 80,100, and 150 Endo for Easy / Medium / Hard enemies!
*You can now select (opt-in to) a ‘Wait For Players’ option when a quickmatch session is not found.

;Syndicate Melees
[[File:TSG Update 2.png|660px|center]]
Represent your favorite Syndicate with these unique entry of weapons. Each weapon is charged with a unique bonus (brainstormed by your Design Council!) and reflect the Syndicates they represent. These weapons have stat changes and a unique passive, but there is no Syndicate burst associated with them. Diversity! All weapons must be equipped in melee mode to benefit from the bonus (save for the Telos Boltace).  

;ARBITERS OF HEXIS
'''[[Telos Boltace]]''' - Push the limits of Tenno lethality with violent spinning attacks that damage all enemies in range. Increased mobility when equipped in melee mode. '''(Weapon Bonus by TunaMayo)'''

;CEPHALON SUDA
'''[[Synoid Heliocor]]''' - This intelligent hammer takes an enemy killed by a channeled attack and recomposes them as an ally if their Codex entry is complete. Any fatal strike with this weapon also performs a codex scan. '''(Weapon Bonus by Design Council collaboration)'''

;NEW LOKA
'''[[Sancti Magistar]]''' - Each charged attack turns the enemy’s pain into a healing pulse that washes over allies. Also, creates resistance to status effects when held. '''(Weapon Bonus by (PS4)Sreza and Design Council collaboration)'''

;PERRIN SEQUENCE
'''[[Secura Lecta]]''' - Whip the enemy out of their ill-gotten gains; double credit drops on kills. '''(Weapon Bonus by Oranji)'''

;RED VEIL
'''[[Rakta Dark Dagger]]''' - Infiltrate undetected; reduced visibility when held. Then strike with confidence; hits to irradiated targets restores shields and creates overshields. '''(Weapon Bonus by Design Council collaboration)'''

;STEEL MERIDIAN
'''[[Vaykor Sydon]]''' - Justice blinds. Each blocked hit charges a Radial Blind, when fully charged drop block to unleash it. '''(Weapon Bonus by Tourach and taiiat)'''

'''Obtain these weapons through Syndicate Offerings. You must reach the top Syndicate Rank to purchase the pertaining weapon.'''

Get Nekros Prime Access now and make the newest Primes yours - instantly - including Nekros Prime, Tigris Prime, Galatine Prime, and exclusive Customizations only available through Prime Access! 

'''Click here for more information on Prime Access:''' https://warframe.com/prime-access 

Nyx Prime, Scindo Prime and Hikou Prime have entered the Prime Vault and their Relics are no longer obtainable in the game. If you already wield the power of these Primes, they will remain in your Inventory. If you already hold Relics in your inventory that house these Primes, they will remain in your inventory and you may continue to play them.

As a responsive measure, a Perrin Sequence and New Loka Syndicate sacrifice -- the Nyx Prime Neuroptics will be replaced with Vauban Prime Neuroptics and Scindo Prime Blade will be replaced with Nikana Prime Blade.

The new Relics added that contain Nekros Prime, Tigris Prime, and Galatine Prime now contain a mix of the unvaulted items from the above removed Relics.

'''Check the in-game Codex in the 'Relics & Arcanes' section to find the drop locations for the new Relics!'''

*Tweaked the Raptor boss tileset to prevent unintended teleporting.
*Increased the spawn chances of Frostleaf.
*Removed butterfly sounds from Titania’s idle animations for other Warframes. Butterfly sounds will only play on Titania’s idle animations with Titania equipped.
*Adjusted the positioning for Porta Armour Leg Plates on Saryn Prime.

'''Endo Fixes:'''
*Upon receiving Endo rewards in endless missions like Survival an Excavation, you will now be shown a total rather than having to mental math on things like '5 x 80'.
*Fixed Endo amounts in mission reward tables across the board. Due to an issue in the conversion, the value assignments were based on "unranked" Cores from the old system rather than a fully ranked Core. All Reward tables are now restored to have the correct Endo within (i.e Excavation, Survival, etc).  If you need a comparison, 1 Common Core (Max Rank) = 15 Endo, 1 Uncommon Core (Max Rank) = 50 Endo, and 1 Rare Core (Max Rank) = 80 Endo.
*Clarity on drops overall for endless missions:
We did a drop audit of our endless tables and decided to reduce the repeat Mods in Rotation C and split what was 100% of Relics in B with C so that C isn't considered a 'wasted' rotation.

 Warframe Profile - Titania 
</gallery>
;Titania

Trance your enemies with the mystical powers of Lotus’ newest warrior, Titania. Overwhelm your enemies with swarms of butterflies, mesmerize and distract foes with shiny lures and morph into a deadly, flying fairy.

*'''SPELLBIND'''
**Enemies fumble their weapons as they are whisked into the air. Nearby allies become immune to Status Effects.
*'''TRIBUTE'''
**Extract an offering from an enemy in the form of a random Ability Buff. Survivor’s attacks are weakened.
*'''LANTERN'''
**Create a swarm of razorflies that transform an enemy into an irresistible floating beacon, attracting witless comrades and finally exploding.
*'''RAZORWING'''
**Shrink down and take flight, while razorflies attack nearby enemies.

;'''Quest: The Silver Grove'''
New Loka has enlisted the Tenno to help protect a sacred forest from the Grineer camping around the sacred grounds. Speak with Amaryn, the leader of New Loka, in the Relay today to claim the quest! Please note: the prerequisite is that you've completed The Second Dream quest.

;NEW WEAPONS AND CUSTOMIZATIONS
*'''OPERATOR OUTFITS''' – Pick up the latest in Operator attire. Now available the vogueish Koppra Outfit and the unconventional Varida Outfit.  
*'''APOXYS SYANDANA''' – This malignant growth hangs elegantly on the shoulders of any Tenno. Complete this look by adding on the matching Pox Weapon. 
*'''SARPA''' – Makes sweeping cuts punctuated by bursts of heavy gunfire.
*'''POX''' – These festering sacs of pus and gas burst violently on impact. Complete this look by adding on the matching Apoxys Syandana.

;'''NEW MELEE STANCE: Bullet Dance!'''
Return to the Orokin Void to find this Stance in the Caches that appear in Sabotage missions! 

;Raptor 2.0 Boss Fight!
The Raptor has a new look and new function! With updated scaling and new combat mechanics, this airborne Corpus threat has never been so fierce! Visit this updated boss battle on the usual node on Europa. Without spoiling things, there are multiple Raptors that occur, and as a result the drop tables have been averaged.

;'''Fusion Simplified: Part 1 is here!'''

If you're asking yourself 'Where are my Fusion Cores and what is Endo?", please read this section carefully! This section explains the conversion from a Fusion Core / Duplicate Mod fusion system to the Endo Fusion system. 

Fusion in Warframe is one of the main systems that encourages investment in your Mod collection and Upgrading your gear. With calculated clicking and collecting, you can take your unranked Mods to top tier performers.

With the change to an Endo system we've removed the hidden complexity of Fusion. This Endo Fusion system maintains many aspects of the hold. 

What is Endo? Endo is Fusion energy incarnate. It is the raw resource that powers the process of Upgrading Mods. In essence, Endo serves as the simplifier in all things Fusion. All duplicate Mods can now be simply converted into Endo. Endo will now drop from enemies and missions where Fusion Cores used to be.
Fusing with Endo makes the Mod Rank increases clear, as the system now only increases in whole Ranks. Partial upgrading with unclear requirements towards your next rank will no longer exist, and neither will wasted Fusion energy. The UI will tell you exactly how much Endo is needed for the next Rank, which gives you a clear goal to work toward.
Any partial Mod upgrades before this Update will be refunded with equivalent Endo and Credits.

;'''So how does the conversion actually work? The base conversion is:'''
* 5 Endo = 1 Unranked Common Core.
* Fusion Credit Costs are now averaged out since Endo is a static Resource and not skewed by Rarity or Polarity in the same way Mods and Fusion Cores were. 
* No more wasted Fusion Energy exists. Often times you'd Fuse a Mod with a Core and would lose some tail end fusion energy. Static Endo amounts mean this is no longer possible.
* All Mods can now be Dissolved into Endo. 
* Fusion Core packs in the Market have been replaced with completely repriced Platinum Endo bundles. 

;'''Part 2 is coming soon and will include:'''
*Treasures: discoverable ancient valuables that can be constructed and converted into high Endo quantities. 
*Trading of Endo (in the form of Treasures).

;Augments!
The following Augment are available today from the appropriate Syndicate Offerings: 
*'''Nyx''': Absorb: Assimilate - Nyx can move at 50% speed while using Absorb, but the area is reduced by half.
*'''Nezha''': Warding Halo: Safeguard - Can now be cast on allies with 50% effectiveness. 
*'''Atlas''': Landslide: Path of Statues - Leave a trail for 12s that petrifies enemies for 6s.

;'''General:'''
*Added Rarity colour grading to the Relic Reward selection screen in Fissure missions. 
*Soft launch of colourblind door symbols! These new symbols should help you determine if a door is locked or unlocked, as they no longer rely on the sole use of colour. 
*Added a warning message when the last member of an Alliance’s creator Clan tries to dissolve the Clan. 
*Added indicators in the Arsenal of how many Forma are installed in gear, and whether or not gear has been fully Mastered! 
*Added a waypoint marker for Cephalon Fragments. 
*Added more Relic Rewards into Rotation A in replacement of some Credit Bundles and Mods. 

;'''Lunaro and Conclave Additions & Changes:'''

Lunaro has been out in the wild for a couple of weeks now, and in this time we've been play testing extensively - internally and externally - and have been listening to your feedback. In an effort to address your concerns and increase the overall playability of the mode we've implemented a number of new gameplay features, arenas, customizations, and back end systems. Read on below for further details:

;New Weapon Skins!

New Conclave weapon skins for the following weapons can now be purchased for standing from Tehsin once you’ve acquired the Typhoon rank:
*Karak
*Kraken
*AkStiletto
*Tipedo
*Glaive
*Soma

;New Arena!
Steel Meridian Themed Map: The valorous troops of the Steel Meridian were greatly pleased by the skill and honor found within Lunaro matches and have constructed a variant of the Arena for friendly Tenno to enjoy. Find the new map in rotation today.

;New Warm-Up System!
Haven't played any Lunaro since launch? Feeling a bit rusty? Well worry no more! The introduction of the new Lunaro Warm-Up system will take players currently waiting in a not full lobby and load them all into a practice session. These sessions will see all active players equipped with their own Lunaro so as to allow everyone the chance to practise basic game mechanics while waiting for additional loadings to join. Once a game is full and ready to begin the match will naturally progress to the proper Lunaro mode with goals, assists, and saves from the previous Warm-Up being wiped clear.

'New Gameplay Mechanics!

'''Ball Magnet Guard''': Many of the loudest complaints about Lunaro were directed to the frequency of possession changes that could occur when a scrum was formed. To help alleviate this we've introduced the Ball Magnet Guard mechanic. This mechanic will allow the player with the ball to absorb a couple of hits, both melee and check attacks, before they lose possession. Initiating a Ball Magnet Guard is as simple as holding down the Ball Magnet button after the Lunaro has been picked up.

'''Passing''' is now a dedicated button. Defaulted to R, this dedicated pass button should make coordination and team play more viable, especially in high-latency environments.

Bringing up the '''Scoreboard''' can now be done with the TAB button bringing Warframe PvP in with more traditional PvP games.*

'''Please note: This change is also reflected in PvE game modes. Pressing TAB will bring up the Progress & Rewards screen without locking the player in place.'''

;New PvP Matchmaking Rules!
Much of the feedback we've received from our seasoned PvP players and newcomers alike was our inscrutable matchmaking rules. We've attempted to stream lines and have separated the rules used to match players in PvE from those used for PvP. Specifics on these PvP specific matchmaking rules are as follows:

When attempting to join a friend you will be placed on their team if there is available space.
If you create a squad and then create/join a PvP lobby you will all be placed on the same team. Subsequent joiners will fill the opposing team slots.
Inviting a Friend who is currently in a squad will attempt to being in the full squad into your current game/lobby.
Attempting to join a PvP match without enough space for you and your squad will now present an error message indicating that there isn't space to accommodate everyone.
A similar error message to the above will be displayed when a full Squad of 4 players attempts to join a Lunaro match.
Invite and Friends Only Lobbies now have a "Switch Team" option.

;New Penalty/Reward System!
Another common gripe that has sometimes been affecting our competitive PvP modes was one that affects almost all games of this nature; rage quitters. While any system we introduce won't be able to completely solve this issue we've enacted a consequence system that will hopefully curb some of the more numerous instances:

*We now track players who quit out of matches including those using the Alt-F4 method.
*The Penalty system has 2 stages; a warning and a penalty applied state:
**The warning stage will appear on the Landing Craft after the game detects that you've quit out of a match prematurely.
**The Penalty Applied state will kick in after a certain % of your last games are determined to have been prematurely left. This state results in an XP Penalty of 75%.
**Player's can climb back out of the Penalty Applied state by completing a corresponding amount of full matches.
*While also negatively affecting rage quitters, we want to encourage those who continue to play while short on players and those who play multiple matches in a row.
**Completing a match you were short on will result in a +20% boost to XP and Standing.
**Completing subsequent matches will results in 10% more XP and Standing after the first match.

;New Custom Lunaro Bindings!
With the launch of Lunaro on Consoles we introduced full customization options for Lunaro controls. With this update we will be introducing the same functionality for PC keyboard and mouse users.

Head over to the Options screen to configure your Lunaro bindings as you see fit!

;'''Soft Launch: Player Hosted Servers'''
Another major complaint directed toward our Conclave game modes has been the potential for laggy experiences due to the game running on our peer to peer system. With this update we will be rolling out the first stages of a potential solution to this issue: volunteer player hosted servers - we've got the tools in place to allow you to host Lunaro. 

At this stage volunteer servers are limited to running Lunaro only, and require a separate dedicated computer to host. 

The initial roll-out will be conducted via an invite-only process due to the need to gauge scalability and success. We will be using this soft launch to gather valuable feedback and stats and once we determine that the system is ready to provide the best experience we will be moving forward with a full scale public release.

;Nekros Changes

'''Desecrate:'''
*Desecrate is now a toggle ability! Energy (or Health if you use the Despoil Augment) are consumed on Desecration. 
*Corpses that enter the Desecrate radius will be eligible for desecration. The first corpse 'heats up' slowly for a couple seconds and then the rest occur in rapid succession (like popcorn).
*Each enemy desecrated will now cost 10 Energy (or Health if the Despoil Augment is equipped). This is affected by Efficiency Mods. 
*Health orbs are no longer guaranteed drops from pilfered corpses. They are now tied in with the chance for additional loot drops.

'''Shadows of the Dead:'''
*The number of Shadows spawned has been reduced to 7 and is no longer affected by Mods. This is a necessary change for performance on all platforms. To compensate for this, Nekros now spawns stronger Shadows prioritized by heavy unites killed with Shield multiplier and draw aggro more heavily. 
*Shadows now live until they die with Health decay over time that is affected by Duration instead of Strength. 
*Shadows of the Dead can be recast while active to spawn new Shadows to replace dead ones, and refill the Health/Shields of the current Shadows.
*&#42;Recasting Shadows of the Dead will also teleport your Shadows to you within limits. (if they are >10m and <40m away) 
*The Shield of Shadows Augment has been reviewed to maintain efficacy with these changes. 

'''Other:'''
*Changed Nekros’ Despoil Augment to reflect his Desecrate changes. 
*Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead Augment - Shield of Shadows - now displays current % damage mitigation as a HUD buff.

;Kubrow Changes

*Increased Kubrow's base damage 150% and base Critical Damage multiplier from 1.6x to 3x so that for a Kubrow fitted with Rank 10 Maul Mod and Rank 10 Bite Mod the average damage would be almost exactly the same as before.

;Void Fissure Changes
We’ve been reading a lot of constructive feedback on Relics, Fissures and the like since Specters of the Rail shipped. With your suggestions and comments in place, we are continuing to tweak Void Fissures/Relics where necessary with the aim to reduce repetition issues and tie this mechanic into the lore of Warframe. The Void is an entity that corrupts, and Void Fissures are no different. 

There is no longer just one 'Void Fissure', Void Fissures can occur again and again as the Void's corrupting energy tears through the Solar System. Fissures now spawn dynamically throughout the level near groups of enemies. The Fissure will corrupt any nearby enemies immediately after spawning. This buffs the enemy, and resets their health/shields. It will also spawn a couple Orokin units along with them, some being Eximus after a certain amount of Fissures. Fissures despawn after a period of time.

The corrupted and newly spawned Orokin units have a chance to drop Reactant, which are auto pickups (no more context action). Once you collect enough, you qualify for the Void Projection reward, and one of your weapons or your Warframe will be buffed for a short period of time based on Era of Void Relic brought. You will be given a random amount of Void Trace as well after collecting enough Reactant. Fissures will continue to spawn throughout the mission.

*Void Traces cap is now Mastery Rank based (100 + 50 * MR).
*Reactant marker now uses the Void Tear icon. The marker is only visible if players don't have enough Reactant.
*Reactant uses a drop range (kill x amount for guaranteed drop) instead of drop chance.
*“Endless” Void Fissure missions are now truly endless with the exception of Defense and Interception. 
*Your Equipped Relic information will now be shown in the Squad info dropdown box (where Equipped Dragon keys appears).
*&#42;Traces are given when you get 10/10 Reactant (no relic needed) and rewarded at End of Mission (between a range of 6-30).

;Conclave Changes & Fixes
*Fixed an issue with Conclave mods with the Max Energy requirement applying their upgrades twice to the Host.
*Reduced melee blocking angle in Conclave.
*Reduced channeled blocking energy cost in Conclave.
*Adjusted the attack order of the Spinning Palms Combo in Conclave Fist stance and slightly increased its damage.

;Star Chart Reborn.

Specters of the Rail – changes to the Origin System are here, Tenno. What ghosts lurk the chambers of abandoned Junctions of a past era?

Find a new way to experience the Origin System with the complete rework of the Star Chart.
 
This redesign of the original Star Chart will bring back the nostalgic roadmap design making it easier for you to travel the Origin System. The map is dynamic; zoom in and out and drag your way around the Origin System. Specific regions and missions will be easier to locate. Also, it will be clear to see which Missions you need to complete thanks to new Junctions -- routes between planets -- guiding you on where to go next.
 
We've replaced and re-assigned many missions, including the removal of Deception and the not-so-popular Archwing Defense.
 
Difficulty, planet progression, and enemy levels have been reassigned to better reflect the modern Solar System.
 
Dedicated memorials have been set up in Relays to display the names of contributing Founders!
[[File:StarChart Update Map.png|center|640px]]

'''Junctions:'''
*Specters of the Rail live here - you must show you are worthy to conquer the Junction and ignite its Planetary travel power.
*Junctions link travel - all players new and old must complete the Task list to activate the Junctions for progression and rewards.
*Junctions reward players with Mastery upon completion! Please note this Mastery reward is quite large, and offsets any Mastery points lost in the Star Chart changes of nodes per planet.


;What does this mean for Quests?

Quest acquisition are now earned at specific Junctions:

*Venus- Mercury Junction: Once Awake, Howl of the Kubrow
*Earth- Mars Junction: The Archwing
*Mars- Phobos Junction: Stolen Dreams
*Jupiter- Europa Junction: The New Strange, Limbo Theorem Blueprint
*Saturn- Uranus Junction: Natah, Clem Quest
*Uranus- Neptune Junction: The Second Dream
*Pluto- Sedna Junction: Hidden Messages Blueprint
*Pluto- Eris Junction: Patient Zero Blueprint, The Jordas Precept Blueprint

&#42;Sands of Inaros Blueprint is still obtained from Baro Ki Teer. 

;Void 2.0

'''Glossary:'''{{clr}}
<u>Void Fissure:</u> A dynamic occurrence throughout the Origin System - a tear in the world of Void energy from Eras past. Represented in the World State Window and occurs in 4 different tiers.

<u>Void Relic:</u> Ancient Relics that react to Void Fissures to reveal treasures within.

<u>Void Traces:</u> Raw Void energy that drops in the process of uniting Relics and Fissures. Can be used to Refine Void Relics to yield more rare rewards in your Orbiter.

<u>Reactant:</u> Drops in missions and must be used in the Void Fissure sealing process.

<u>Refinement:</u> The Process of improving the likelihood of Rare rewards from Void Relics.

<u>Era:</u> An old Orokin age.

<u>Lith / Meso / Neo / Axi:</u> 4 Distinct Eras of the Orokin past, all suddenly manifesting through Void Fissures in the Solar Map.
:T1 Keys have turned into Lith Era Relics.
:T2 Keys have turned into Meso Era Relics.
:T3 Keys have turned into Neo Era Relics
:T4 Keys have turned into Axi Era Relics.

<u>Void Relic Segment:</u> Found on a Junction, used to Refine Void Relics. 

;Void Fissures & Relics
After years of new content releases and updated items to collect, there is a certain irony in calling the Void the “void”. Until Specters of the Rail, getting specific Prime parts was a repetitive and regimented process. Each Tower mission has a corresponding key and reward table, and if you want one of those rewards, you need to stock up on the appropriate key and repeat the same mission until you accomplish your goal. That all changes with the introduction of Relics. Instead of running the same mission repeatedly, Relics allow you to dynamically acquire the rewards you want by playing Void Tear missions that appear on any planet, and there will always be Void Fissures active. Collecting cool rewards is a fundamental aspect of Warframe, and this new Void system is designed to make it more fun and immersive - with Void Fissures ripping into the very fabric of the Origin System!

&#42;Please note that Void Fissures will not be available for Assassinate and endless mission types - excluding Survival - for Launch. Further mission support will be coming shortly.

Read the Developer Workshop here: [https://forums.warframe.com/topic/667312-dev-workshop-projections-void-tears/ link]

'''As a result of this change:'''

*Syndicate Void Key Pack has changed to Relic Pack.
*Void Key Pack from the Market and Daily Tribute has changed to Relic Pack.
*As for our good friend Baro, his sales/prices will be monitored closely to take new economy into account in terms of Ducat acquisition.
*Access to the Derelicts is remaining the same.

'''New Resource - Void Traces!'''
To help players acquire higher quality Void Relic's we've introduced a new resource: Void Traces. Void Traces are guaranteed to drop by sealing a Void Fissure. Players will be able to spend these in the Void Relic Segment of their Landing Craft to refine Void Relics. While each individual Relic will have a predetermined set of items that can be acquired from within them, their quality level will affect the likelihood of rarer items being received once the Relic is used to seal a Void Fissure.

The Refinement costs for improving an INTACT Void Relic are as follows:

*EXCEPTIONAL = 25 Void Traces
*FLAWLESS = 50 Void Traces
*RADIANT = 100 Void Traces

'''Dragon Keys:'''

Dragon Keys will now require 10 Void Traces to craft instead of Void Keys. Their blueprints have also been moved to a more appropriate place: the Orokin Lab!

'''How to acquire Relics:'''

You can get Relics by playing through certain regular mission types (typically endless missions). Any Void Keys you have will be converted into Relics of a similar Era. Relics are not restricted to Towers and precise missions the way Void Keys are, so all Void Keys of a particular Era will be converted into Relics of a similar reward level. 


<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
'''Warframe Mission Sound 2.0'''
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
This Update brings a huge change to the way our distance and obstruction sound works across all of Warframe. All distant sounds now feel properly spatialized and obstructed sounds now have the feeling of walls and more. Each shot, each character sound, each infested squeal will now bring you a more visceral and deep sound experience.

We updated many weapon sounds to have elements that take advantage of this new sound system. 
</div>
</div>

'''Archwing Overhaul!'''
*Archwing has been upgraded to a full six degrees of freedom! Now, you’ll be able to pilot your Archwing like a true flight simulator with full 360 degree yaws and pitches. (Note: submersible missions will still use the old controls)
*New Archwing UI and control bindings to further enhance your flying experience!
*New Eximus Archwing units have been deployed throughout the Origin System!
*Syndicates now offer Warframe components!
*Reduced the total number of Archwing nodes to 8 - one of each type for Grineer and Corpus.


'''New Archwing Mission Types!'''

Archwing Pursuit (Saturn - Pandora)
*Hunt down a heavily defended Grineer Ship and destroy it by fighting through the ship’s defenses, such as: energy shields, turrets, and mines.

Archwing Rush (Phobos - Kepler)

;Market Overhaul!
The Warframe Market got a facelift! Two big motivators behind this rework are pretty straight-forward: a) to make it easier to find what you want and to see what’s available; and b) to allow the Market to grow as more content is added in-game. Highlights of this upgrade include better item categories (especially for Cosmetics) and a brand new search function to help you fine-tune your results. A new hide/show owned button will make browsing for new gear a breeze, but for those who need to save up for the big ticket items, the new Wishlist feature will help you keep track of your must-haves. Feeling particularly generous? You can see your friends’ Wishlists and gift them what their heart desires!

A large majority of Market-related complaints we receive relate to the confusion between built items (aka Platinum-purchased) and Blueprints. The current Market set-up can misguide players into thinking that Warframes, Weapons, and Sentinels aren’t craftable in-game, so we condensed the Built items and Blueprints into the same page. Information about build costs, stats, blueprint location, and more, will be separated into 3 tabs on this page to help players learn all they need to know about the item in order to make an informed purchase!

;PvE/PvP Stance Alterations + New PvP Melee Stance Mods:
We've decided to remove the functionality of PvE stances within Conclave matches. This design choice was implemented as we felt the current moveset provided by the PvE stances didn't quite fit the feel of our PvP gameplay. Using animations from existing melee Stances, alternative versions have been created with a focus on gap closing moves and shorter combos to better fit the pace of Warframe Conclave.

A list of these new Conclave Melee Stance mods can be found below. Each of these mods can be purchased from Teshin at Rank 1.

*Argent Scourge (Polearm)
*Biting Piranha (Dual Daggers)
*Celestial Nightfall  (Glaive)
*Crashing Havoc (Hammer)
*Crashing Timber (Staves)
*Cunning Aspect (Rapier)
*Dividing Blades (Dual Sword)
*Fateful Truth (Katana)
*Lashing Coil (Whip)
*Last Herald (Sword and Shield)
*Mafic Rain (Nunchaku)
*Noble Cadence (Heavy Blade)
*Piercing Fury (Dagger)
*Quaking Hand (Fists)
*Rending Wind (Machete)
*Rising Steel (Sword)
*Scarlet Hurricane (Claws)
*Shadow Harvest  (Scythe)
*Star Divide (Tonfa)
*Tainted Hydra (Sword + Whip)
*Vicious Approach (Fists + Feet)

All melee weapons available in Conclave have had their damage adjusted to work with their new stances.

;Abilities & Augments vs Nullifiers
We’ve added some changes to Nullifiers - rather, we’ve fixed how they affect others on the battlefield. We've gone over every player ability and augment to provide predictable interactions with Nullifier bubbles and ability immune enemies. Below are the rules that we have adhered by to offer a consistent avenue for players to strategize against foes in-battle.

*Abilities will not affect players or enemies within a Nullifier bubble.
*Effects of an ability on both players and enemies will be removed when entering Nullifier bubbles.
*A Warframe’s active abilities will be deactivated upon entering a Nullifier bubble.
*Projectiles spawned by an ability will be deflected when they encounter a Nullifier bubble. For example, Ember’s Fireball and Ash’s Shuriken will be deflected.
*Abilities that exist independent of their creator will not be deactivated if the Warframe enters a nullifier, but will be destroyed if touched by the bubble itself. For example, Frost’s Snowglobe will not disappear when Frost enters the bubble, but will be destroyed if the bubble comes into contact with the Snowglobe sphere.

;Interception Changes & Fixes
*Adjusted the enemy counts for each mission; in most cases the spawn counts were increased.
*Improved enemy tactics to better plan assaults on player-controlled towers; by staging units ahead of time they can be more effective and draw the action to different points around the map.
*Changed how the different types of enemy unit are sent into the fray. Historically you'd see higher-tier units mid-way through the first round and there would be no escalation after that; you should now see more infantry in the first round and then more support and heavy units if you chose to stay to intercept more transmissions.
*Tuned the enemy tables to fix the cases where certain levels were 50% enemies that couldn't capture points (eg: Drones).
*Corrupted Vor in T4 Interception will no longer delay the end of round countdown (just the end of round) so that if he's the last enemy you aren't stuck waiting as long.
*Fixed the problem where low-level Interception missions were flooded with Eximus’.
*Added an Interception Mission to Sedna, Berehynia.

<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
'''Changes:'''
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
*Toxic Ancient's and Ancient Disrupter Auras will no longer stack with multiple Ancients of the same type.
*Oberon’s Reckoning will now revive downed companions!

*Fire rate Pistol mods will now affect Mesa's Peacemaker.
*Added a PBR pass on materials for a variety of older Grineer and Infested levels.
*Made improvements to the spawn logic for Convergence pickups in Survival and Excavation missions.
*Phobos Tileset is now on Mars, and all Phobos missions are now on Asteroid Tileset.
*Increased Dark Split-Swords Critical Chance while dual wielding by to 25% and Critical Multiplier to 2.5x.
*Slightly increased the Dark Split Sword dual wield attack speed.
*Slightly decreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade attack speed.
*Increased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade  Element Damage to 90 and Status Chance to 25%
*Increased the Twin Basolk Status Chance to 40% and increased Elemental damage to 65.
*Slightly Increased Twin Basolk attack speed.
*Increased Twin Basolk Ground Slam damage by 4x , attack radius to 7.5m, and Status Chance to 65%.
*Twin Basolk Ground Slams can now ragdoll enemies.
*Increased the amount of Impact damage done with Stradavar automatic fire while decreasing the Puncture and Slash damage these attacks do.
*Increased the amount of Puncture damage done with Stradavar semi-automatic fire while decreasing the amount of Slash damage these attacks do.
*Slightly decreased the amount of damage done by Stradavar automatic fire and increased the amount of damage done by semi-automatic attacks.
*Increased the Stradavar Status Chance to 15%.
*Polished the hit detection of melee weapons within Nullifier bubbles. Some weapons, like the Tonbo for example, would strike the Nullifier bubble first, followed by the Nullifier agent in the same strike. However, the damage would only result on the bubble! The weapons can now strike both the bubble and the agent on the same strike, and the agent will take damage as long you are inside the bubble for the attack.
*Removed in-mission challenges for all Mastery rank tests.
*Removed two small sections on Nyx Prime that were un-tintable.
*Adjusted the Market icon size of the Akstilleto and Ballistica.
*Changed the way lighting works on Sigils in an attempt tone down excessive bloom.
*Sortie Missions can now have more environmental wrinkles, traps, and obstacles within. Stay Alert!
*Made improvements to the animation look and feel of thrown weapons while holding a Datamass.
*As a result of wanting to reduce the amount of playerbase splitting that the Syndicate Mission rank generation created, we've reduced this to simply have 7 missions per Syndicate.
**At Rank 1 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 1, 2, 3.
**At Rank 2 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 2, 3, 4.
**At Rank 3 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 3, 4, 5.
**At Rank 4 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 4, 5, 6.
**At Rank 5 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 5, 6, 7.
**As a result, now you are more likely play with other members of the Syndicate at close ranks to you. You will still now have 3 Syndicate missions active in your World state menu, but you should now have more people do them with!

*Warframe Helmet blueprints are now labeled as ‘Neuroptics’. Please note that when trading components, full Warframe sets now contain Systems, Chassis, and Neuroptics (previously Helmet) as components.
*Polished a variety of environment materials that were too bright.
*Polished a variety of old tileset decoration placements and layouts.

*Updated certain interactable Orokin Derelict consoles with new meshes.

*Reduced the Syndicate buff FX to help aiming visibiltiy as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/637829-syndicate-effects-are-a-bit-much/
*Increased the spawn rate of Rare Crates in The Jordas Verdict to match the Law of Retribution.
*The Archwing ability stat screen will now show the correct range for abilities depending on context. (E.g. Blink used to show 100m, but in space you are 0.25x scale so distances are effectively 4x as far. So in space Blink will now show 400m. In water ranges are reduced, so Blink will show 39.69m.)

*Gave Rescue hostages their own (incredibly generous) cover evaluators so their cover findings don't conflict with their behaviour. Gave them larger vision range so they react to dangers behind / next to them and not just when they get shot by them first.

*Improved finisher hit detection for multiple weapons. Reticles will now flash red when a finisher can be performed and with each hit for multistrike finisher moves.
*Multistrike finisher moves will have their damage split amongst each hit instead of now being delivered all at the end.

*Propaganda Drone damage reduction buffs no longer stack.

*Improved jump detection. Before players could prematurely double jump when just about to fall off a ledge, when falling off a small edge, or when walking down a steep incline. Regular jumps will now be performed in these scenarios.

*Improved Dojo and Liset decoration placement code.
*Vauban’s Bastille now works on Corpus air units. (Attack Drones, etc.)
*Increased the drop rate of Automatic Trigger.

*Increased the drop rate of Vermillion Storm.

*Improved squad merging code to better facilitate Lunaro matchmaking.

Warframe at E3 - New 'Lunaro' Game Mode Coming Soon
</gallery>
;Lunaro!
Tenno, you’ve fought long and valiantly. Now, put down your arms and join in the newest addition to Conclave. The honor-bound sport, Lunaro!

A contact ball sport played long ago by Tenno of years past, Lunaro is a new Conclave mode that accommodates up to four players per team. This new game mode focuses on skill, mobility, teamwork and creativity. 

Work together on team Sun or Moon to move the ball -- or Lunaro -- up an Orokin arena, into the opponent's goal. Defend your zone by smashing the Lunaro out of your opponent’s possession or knocking them to the ground with a crushing hit.

A letter on 'Lunaro Rules!' from [DE] Steve:
Source: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/660207-lunaro-rules/

To get started Playing Lunaro, visit the Conclave station on your Landing Craft. You will be able to play the Practice tutorial there, it'll help!

We've received word from the Lotus that everyone will have 7 days following the launch of 18.13.2 to claim a free [[Forma]] via inbox simply by logging in shortly after we launch.

With the power of all your Draco runs, we have intercepted this message:

{{quote|You have fought long and hard for our cause - learning to master many Warframes and Weapons in your Arsenal. Take this gift of Forma as a token of my appreciation for your willingness to bend the will of your equipment to suit your needs on the battlefield.|The [[Lotus]]}}

'''Trinity Changes & Fixes:'''
*'''Blessing''': Damage Resistance is no longer calculated based on an Average, but instead a flat value simply capped at 75% (which can be achieved via use of Strength mods). The squad UI now shows who is in range with the Tenno Affinity marker.
*Fixed Trinity’s Blessing dealing a possible infinite damage multiplier.

'''Valkyr Changes:'''
*'''Hysteria''': Each kill reduces her Hysteria Aura by 1 meter, the aura will continue to grow but killing frequently will keep it tight around you so you can control its range.

'''Mag Changes & Fixes:'''
*Improved the FX of Mag’s Polarize.
*Fixed Mag’s Crush FX not playing properly for Clients.
*Fixed Mag’s Magnetize bubble being invisible when inside it.
*Fixed Mag dealing self-damage with Magnetize.

'''Enemy Plasma Grenade Changes:'''
*Before Plasma Grenades explode, they will live for 3 seconds after coming to a rest on the ground.
*Plasma Grenades can now be shot in air or when they are on the ground.
*When an enemy Plasma Grenade is shot and killed, it will explode and damage any enemies in range with no damage to you. A Tenno with a keen ear will be able to identify these threats and counter them with an accurate shot before it's too late.

'''Enemy Changes & Fixes:'''
*'''Ballistas''' will have telegraphing when they are winding up to fire off a round from their deadly Vulkars. An observant Tenno will be better able to identify and prioritize these threats.
*'''Hyekka Masters''': Fixed the Hyekka Master’s Ignis dealing damage through walls.

;Starting Mod Capacity Changes
The starting Mod Capacity for your gear (new or Forma'd) is now determined by your Mastery Rank and if an item has an Orokin Reactor or Catalyst installed.

For example, a Mastery 20 player would experience the following:
#Claim a new Warframe from the Foundry with no Reactor installed.
#Observe the 'Unranked' item and see the starting Mod capacity is 20.
#Install a Reactor, observe the Mod capacity has doubled to 40.

The formula is: ''Starting Mod Capacity = Mastery Rank (x2 if Orokin Reactor/Catalyst installed)''

The cap on capacity remains unchanged.

Please note this is a slight deviation of our discussions on how Mastery Rank will reflect gear level, but by affecting capacity it fundamentally enables you to use Mods the moment you get your hands on new gear or Forma an item. Have fun!

;Hek Sound Changes
As widely requested, Hek’s original sound has been restored and our Sound Team has made it work with the new weapon sound tech.

Our Audio Director, [DE]George, has provided insight into why we changed the Hek sound originally here: [https://forums.warframe.com/topic/536444-hek-shooting-sound/?do=findComment&comment=7327137 link]

'''Warframe Changes & Revisions '''

'''Mag Changes'''
*'''[[Pull]]''': Pull remains mostly the same as before. If an enemy is magnetized, bonus damage is dealt. Kills have a bonus chance of dropping energy, while causing enemies to experience almost physics-defying deaths.
*'''[[Magnetize]]''': Magnetize (previously Bullet Attractor) will root the target in place. Damage over time is dealt to all enemies within a set radius, with the amount of damage based on how far from the center of the Magnetized they are. A percentage of the damage of absorbed bullets/projectiles/shrapnel will be used to increase the DOT. Up to 4 targets can be Magnetized at this time.
*'''[[Polarize]]''': Polarize now spreads like Nova’s Molecular Prime that expands out over time. Targets with shields will take a fixed shield damage (no longer a %), while targets with armour take health damage and a permanent armour debuff. Targets will emit a piece or two of shrapnel which can be used to create synergies with Mag's other abilities. 
*'''[[Crush]]''': Will now deal bonus damage to magnetized enemies.

'''Volt Changes'''
*'''[[Speed]]''': Speed most noticeably has had its FOV reduced on cast, which should help with motion sickness complaints. Other players in range now get to 'opt-in' to Volt's Speed buff, by activating a pickup that Volt leaves behind on cast. This activation occurs on contact.
*'''[[Electric Shield]]''': Electric Shield has received a graphic overhaul to improve the look of casting, ambient effects, and its effect on projectiles that pass through. Shield now offers strong synergies if Shock is cast through it – it charges the shield with Electric damage which will hurt enemies that come in contact. As a late-addition driven by player demand, Shield can now be picked up with a context action which limits weapon usage and drains energy.
*'''Overload''', now called ''''[[Discharge]]''''. '''Discharge''' still spreads out from Volt in a wave, and enemies who come into contact are turned into stationary 'Tesla Coils' that arc and zap nearby enemies in range. Damage is dealt to the enemy-turned- Tesla Coil and its targets. Loot crates can also be turned into Coils, but they only have one charge. Casting Shock on Tesla Coil causes an AOE burst.
*The [[Capacitance]] Discharge Augment has been balanced to reflect Discharge’s new changes. The balanced Shield Bonus given is now 1.5/2/2.5/3%. 

'''Mesa Changes'''
*Mesa's personal '''[[Peacemaker]]''' weapon now scales with Secondary Weapon Mods. To accommodate the increase in power, Peacemaker's base stats have been reduced. 
*Mesa’s '''[[Shooting Gallery]]''' will now grant her a permanent buff, but Allies will still have it rotate. 

'''Mirage Changes'''
*'''[[Sleight Of Hand]]''': We have increased the damage and detonation range of all objects that can be booby trapped. 
*'''[[Prism]]’s''' Blind effect is now affected by the enemy's Line-of-Sight (LoS) to the Prism. Prism’s damage has been buffed slightly to compensate for this change. We found that Prism was able to lock down maps with little recourse, and we feel that these changes will make it a more targeted ability while also increasing its tactical usage. 

'''Valkyr Changes'''
*'''[[Hysteria]]''' is Valkyr's Rage Mode - we teased and released her as a Berserker frame and we've iterated on Hysteria a couple of times since release. We are returning to this power to reign in its issues but still thematically invoke her ultimate rage. 

*The relationship between time spent in Hysteria and energy & incoming damage has changed in two ways.
**Firstly, the longer you stay in Hysteria, the more Energy it'll cost you. (but the energy drain ramp up is capped). 
**Secondly, while in Hysteria you are still invulnerable - the current Hysteria indicator on the UI tells you how much incoming damage you've absorbed and mitigated. The longer you stay in Hysteria, the less effective the mitigation of incoming damage is on the 'End Hysteria' phase. Ending your Hysteria session should be done with care - ensuring no enemies are in the range of Valkyrs Hysteria Aura (20 meters max, they have to be able to see you), or you will take the damage. How you choose to dispose of these enemies is up to you - either kill them, or get a safe distance away to deactivate Hysteria. 

'''Excalibur Changes'''
Excalibur's rework made him an indisputable lethal force - a role he will continue to shine in, but now with more reasonable parameters on his Exalted Blade waves. 

*'''[[Exalted Blade]]’s''' damage will now diminish according to distance travelled and enemies punctured, and Exalted Blade’s built-in Radial Blind on spin will now cost ½ the Energy of a regular Radial Blind. Although Exalted Blade is a lot of fun, we feel that it completely overshadows all of Excalibur’s other abilities at little cost. The powerful range on Exalted Blade turned Excalibur into more of a turret than a swordsman. This change means that Exalted Blade is more effective when used in close range and using Radial Blind is now a calculated choice. The ability will simply become more engaging in all encounters. 

'''Trinity Changes'''
*'''[[Blessing]]''': Blessing now heals Allies within the shared Tenno Affinity aura range. This Tenno Affinity aura range is a new UI feature available to all players beside the Shield Stat. This range is 50 meters from Trinity. 
*Blessing still instantly heals all Allies (Tenno,Companions, etc) in range. 
*Blessing's Damage Resistance is now calculated by the following formula: 
Damage Resistance % = 100 - Square (Average (Tenno Health %)).

:''[https://forums.warframe.com/topic/652449-dev-workshop-part-2-more-warframe-changes/ Dev Workshop Part 2: ...& more Warframe Changes.]''

'''Warframe Passives'''

Numerous Warframe’s have received passives! You can view each passive under the ‘Abilities’ tab on each Warframe. 

*'''Ash''': Bleed Procs dealt by Ash from any source are 25% deadlier and last 50% longer.
*'''Banshee''': All weapons are treated as silent.
*'''Ember''': Receiving a Heat Status effect will regenerate energy for the duration of the Status effect (10 energy per second) and increase Power Strength by 35%.
*'''Hydroid''': Every Melee Ground-Slam has a 50% chance to lure a Tentacle that will last 15 seconds. 
*'''Limbo''': Holster Speed and Reload Speed is 50% faster while in the Rift, and movement speed increases by 10% while in the Rift.
*'''Loki''': 10x Wall-Cling duration!
*'''Mag''': Vacuum effect on every Bullet Jump.
*'''Nekros''': Enemy death within 10 meters of Nekros regenerates a 5 Health.
*'''Nova''': When Nova is knocked down, she will knock down enemies in a 6 meter Radius + deal damage.
*'''Nyx''': Enemies affected by any of Nyx's powers have a chance to lay down their weapon ( become disarmed ).
*'''Oberon''': All wildlife (neutral or enemy faction) within a 10 meter range of Oberon will become allies and fight for Oberon for 20 seconds.
*'''Trinity''': Revive fallen allies faster from further away.
*'''Vauban''': Other Warframes within 20 meters give you 25% bonus armour.
*'''Volt''': Physical ground-travel distance between attacks causes bonus Electrical damage on next attack.

'''Conclave Changes & Fixes'''
*Fixed Ivara’s Null-Shield Arrow not applying when casted consecutively in Conclave. 
*Changed the ‘Rapid Consequence’ Sniper Mod title to ‘Emergent Aftermath’ in Conclave.
*Fixed Nova’s Antimatter Mine augment not being affected by range Mods for Clients in Conclave.
*Fixed Nova’s Antimatter Mine augment absorbing other player’s bullets in Conclave. 

'''Interception Changes'''
*With the new shared Tenno Affinity aura HUD indicator, Interception missions will no longer apply a Affinity radius multiplier. The HUD now clearly indicates if you are within range of your fellow Tenno to gain the shared Tenno Affinity. This change will still encourage players to spread out amongst the map, but to also be aware of the shared Affinity Limits.  

|changes        =

*Warframe Mod text descriptions are receiving a visual overhaul! All Mod descriptions are being manually audited by our team to reflect appropriate status icons and uniform text case. Our goal is to bring consistency to all Mods, and so far almost every Mod has been updated to this format! We ask that you be patient with this change as we comb through Warframe’s extensive Mod collection. This change is purely visual to reduce overly verbose descriptions and discrepancy, and does not affect the functionality of these Mods in any way.

;Enemy Spawning Adjustments (Missed 18.5 Note)
Update 18.5 contained a change made to ensure that enemies will no longer spawn in areas that have been cleared, as long as the level is not on alert. This change was made to help prevent an exploit that caused enemies to rapidly spawn in the same room only to be instantly killed by stealthed players, and these enemies never scaled. This was limited mostly to Deception Missions, but was present in Sabotage, Mobile Defense or Spy Missions as well.

Enemies will now spawn in areas not yet seen by players.  This will allow players to clear rooms stealthily, while avoiding enemies spawning behind players and potentially ruining any stealth runs. ‘Alerted’ enemies will spawn nearby and out of sight, but can also spawn in rooms already seen by players.

These changes will not affect enemy spawning in Exterminate, Excavation, Survival or Defense Missions, but will have a slight impact on enemy spawning on other Mission types. 
|changes        =
*Loot Crates obtained in the Orokin Moon tileset puzzle rooms will no longer play rare Loot Crate audio FX which mislead players.

;Lighting Improvements
Firstly, this is a sweeping change across the entire game! Please be conscious that some areas may appear overly or underlit. We will work to fix up any rough looking spots - feel free to send screenshots are way in bug threads throughout the appropriate subforums.

With Inaros, the sands of old have been swept away from U18 Warframe leaving behind a newer, more vibrant U18.5 Warframe. In many respects, 18.5 is a remastered, more HD version of Warframe with months of technical graphical improvements and artistic relighting of many parts of the game (and more to come in subsequent updates). On top of these changes are across the board rendering performance improvements we hope you'll enjoy, keep in mind that your particular hardware may benefit more and benefit less depending on your GPU, resolution and preferred graphics settings.
*Lighting textures have been reengineered to reduce square compression artifacts and ugly color banding. You may have seen me point this out on past Devstreams.
*All PBR materials have been recompressed with a more accurate format, new and subtle details are visible on your PBR'd Warframes, gear and in the environment.
*Reflection Probes have been built through many areas of the game, grounding PBR materials with more accurate lighting.
*Character and weapon lighting includes more accurate 'dual specular' lighting which means metallic surfaces are more realistic and fancy looking.
*HDR rendering has been switched to a compact 32bit format which has improved HDR rendering performance for a wide range of GPUs.
*Tonemapping has been adjusted to use more of the range of lighting content in the game, images have more detail, particularly richer in the darks.
*Motion Blur and Depth of Field have been re-engineered to run faster and look better, fast moving and defocused objects no longer appear 'cut out' on their silhouettes.
*Draw order optimizations have been applied to every object in the game, which improves overall performance, particularly in worst-case scenarios.
*Atmospheric fog effects are now rendering in a separate lighting pass, allowing richer particle effects at distance without being 'erased' by atmosphere.
*Particle lighting has been improved to more accurately represent the local lighting environment.
*Wind force modelling on many particle systems increase realism as various environmental particles now respond to explosive forces and Warframe powers – you've also probably seen us showcase this in our most recent Devstream.
*Bloom system has been softened and made more seated in the scene. The burnt-out look is replaced with a more subtle and gentle sci-fi glow.
*Physics collision, performance and stability have all been improved, as a long-awaited upgrade of Warframe PhysX libraries has been completed.

*Ferrite has replaced Alloy Plate as a Resource Drop in Void missions.

;'''Reminder: Soft Launch: 2 Factor Authentication'''

Accounts can opt-in at [http://www.warframe.com/ warframe.com]user shortly after this Update is live. Be sure to check your spam folder for any confirmation emails. If you still aren't receiving emails, add no-reply@warframe.com to your whitelist and allowed contacts.

*There is now a 30-Second window in [[Interception]] missions once you've intercepted the message to kill all enemies and collect loot. Once this 30 seconds up, you'll be prompted by the Reward screen. This should prevent progression stoppers in Rounds where the game thinks there are enemies left.

*[[Djinn]]'s [[Fatal Attraction]] precept has been substantially improved:
**As before, Djinn starts by mesmerizing all enemies in range and lures them towards the player; if it succeeds in attracting enough prey into striking-distance it sprays an acid attack that does damage over time and eats away at enemy armor while they writhe in pain.
**With the improvements made to the Fatal Attraction precept it is now much more effective at incapacitating enemies and gets more efficient as players eliminate mesmerized enemies.

**The acid spray now does a guaranteed corrosive damage proc to eat away at enemy armor.
**Fatal Attraction's range at higher-ranks has been slightly reduced to make it easier to eliminate all targets and get the minimum cooldown.
**Each enemy can only be affected by one Fatal Attraction once.
**It no longer works on Corpus Nullifiers, Bosses or enemies immune to mind-control.
*Fixed Clients being unable to see the effects on Djinn while luring.
*Nekros' [[Desecrate]] can now affect enemy Osprey units.

Depending on the resolution you play at, and the speed of your graphics cards, you may be able to increase the setting from the default 4X to 8X or even 16X to improve the clarity of textures on slanted surfaces. Older laptops and computers without dedicated graphics cards will likely want this option off to improve performance. '''Note:''' if you had previously disabled Anisotropic Filtering, you will want turn the new setting off because it has been reset to defaults.
*Changed [[Shade]]'s [[Ghost]] and the [[Huras Kubrow]]'s [[Stalk]] Abilities to avoid using invisibility while the players are doing something that draws aggro (eg: [[Nyx]]'s [[Absorb]]).
*Reduced the size of the [[Imperator]]'s muzzle flash FX.
*All Warframe Accessories have had their naming structure name to have the Warframe first, then the item name. This is to assist alphabetical sorting so players can look through the Market and see 'Volt Pulse Helmet', rather than 'Pulse Volt Helmet'.

;'''The Jordas Verdict:'''
Face your greatest Trial yet.  A massive Corpus ship with signs of heavy infestation has appeared in the System, unlike anything the Tenno have encountered before.  Exploring the ship will require speed and cunning as clouds of Infested spores threatens to consume anything that dares enter.
{{clr}}
Too dangerous to approach with a landing craft, Tenno will need to deploy Archwing to find an entry point into the drifting ship.  Surviving in such thickly Infested space means Tenno must move quickly, and once inside, the Lotus' warriors must find a way to endure the constant barrage of Infested spores.
{{clr}}
Multiple expeditions into the ship may be required, but only a squad fully equipped to handle the mounting infestation will be able to dispatch this threat.
{{clr}}
''A special note:  The Jordas Verdict is still in its Beta, and we appreciate your patience while we make refinements to our most mechanically complex Mission in Warframe to date.  Expect any issues that may arise mid-Trial to be addressed in future updates.''

;'''New Enemies:'''
*Esophage:  Part of an interconnected network of Infested organs. Function remains unclear.

;'''New Arcanes:'''
New Arcanes are here! Beat The Jordas Verdict to find them all!

;'''How to get started:'''
*The Jordas Verdict Trial Key can be purchased from the Market, and must be crafted before the Trial can be accessed.
*The Jordas Verdict does have Archwing gameplay, and equipping a high-level Loadout is recommended.
*Leaderboards can be found here: '''http://content.warframe.com/dynamic/trialGolemStats.php '''
|changes        =
*Made various optimizations to the installation and launch of Warframe.

'''Survival Changes & Fixes:'''
*Fixed an issue where Personal Life Support Capsules would give 2x the intended amount when picked up by Clients in certain scenarios. This bug has existed since Survival was introduced, and is a huge contributor in why Solo missions are so much harder in Survival (no Clients to get 2x the Life Support).
*Changed the amount of seconds each Personal Life Support Capsule gives from 4 seconds to 7 seconds (please note that the unit here is seconds, not percent).
*'''General Note:''' Restored the Personal Life Support Capsule drop chances to pre Update 17.2.4 values. What this means in the short term is that the stakes and pressure are back to being very low (for now). With the 17.2.5 version of Survival, it is likely that having a full row of unused Life Support Towers will be easy to achieve, especially in a group setting. However, work is ongoing to strike a balance in what the right amount of urgency in Life Support is.

;Survival Changes&#58;
Spawning fixes and tileset tweaks over the past year greatly improved flow by reducing enemy travel time to players, upped the intensity of attackers and grouped enemies together into more tightly packed squads, and increased availability of points during spawn selection. While we're happy with these changes to enemies, one side effect is that survival difficulty drifted over the past few months to where it is now; plentiful large canisters and no reason to use them, even when not trying to stockpile them.
We'd like to bring back the original frantic gameplay style of Survival, dashing from room to room while facing hordes of enemies against the clock. We've tried this solo, in small teams and in full squads, everything from Apollodorus to T4 Survival, and as far as we can tell the changes feel awesome.
Upcoming Changes:<br/>
- Each PLS drop is now worth +4 seconds of life support time instead of +6 seconds<br/>
- Small reduction to PLS drop rate (around 90% of what it was)<br/>
We'd love to hear your feedback and will continue to test and tweak if needed.

With these changes players will be given true freedom of movement without limitations such as being required to use specific weapons or becoming locked into restrictive animations.

Players will be given a quick tutorial of the changes made in Parkour 2.0 when logging in for the first time after the Update is live.  Players can choose to skip this tutorial, or replay it from the Advanced Movement menu in the Training section of the Codex.

The following features have been added to Warframe’s movement system:

*'''Double Jump:'''  Players can now use a second jump while in mid-air.  Players will be able to jump again immediately after touching any surface or enemy.
*'''Bullet Jump:''' Pressing the ‘Jump’ button after sliding will send the player into a mid-air dash, temporarily improving movement speed.  Players can use a Bullet Jump as a double jump in any direction.
*'''Wall Latch:''' Pressing the ‘Right Mouse Button’ button against a wall will allow players to latch onto flat surfaces for a limited duration.  Players may fire their equipped Primary or Secondary weapon while using Wall Latch.
*'''Wall Dash:'''  Pressing the ‘Jump’ button while against any surface will allow players to hop along the surface in any direction.  This can be used to scale vertical surfaces, and can be chained indefinitely.
*'''Aim Gliding:'''  Using the ‘Aim’ button while in mid-air will slow the player’s fall speed, enabling a slow glide that players can fire their weapon in any direction from.
*'''Ziplines:'''  Pressing X while near a zipline will allow players to jump directly onto the zipline.  Players can now run or dash along ziplines, and X to jump on a zipline can be done after a double jump.
*'''Stamina has now been removed from the game.'''
*Parrying now only blocks a base percentage of incoming damage.
**Channeling while parrying will block 100% of incoming damage, and reflect a percentage of the damage back at the cost of Energy.

;Chroma + Stamina Related Changes:
*Chroma's green energy perk now gives a buff to holster and reload speed instead of affecting Stamina.
*Mods that previously affected Stamina have now been converted to the appropriate amount of Fusion Core.
*All Alternate Helmets that had Stamina-related effects have been given new abilities:
*Arcane Chorus Helmet - This helmet is worn by Banshee, and adds Power Efficiency, but reduces duration of Aim Glide and Wall Latch.
*Arcane Flux Helmet - This helmet is worn by Nova, and increases duration of Aim Glide and Wall latch, but reduces Health.
*Arcane Storm Helmet - This helmet is worn by Volt, and increases Power Strength, but reduces duration of Aim Glide and Wall Latch.
*Arcane Gambit Helmet - This helmet is worn by Vauban, and increases velocity of parkour maneuvers, with a reduction to Power Duration.
*Arcane Scorpion Helmet - This helmet is worn by Ash, increases duration of Aim Glide and Wall Latch while sacrificing Power Efficiency.
*Arcane Menticide Helmet - This helmet is worn by Nyx, increases velocity of parkour maneuvers with a drain on Shields.

;Uranus Tileset Expansion
Uranus Mission nodes have been given a total overhaul with the new Grineer Underwater Lab tileset.  With this expansion come unique Missions that require players to swap back and forth between their Archwing in order to access (and traverse) the hostile underwater environment that has kept these labs hidden for so long.  Players must have an equippable Archwing in order to access these Missions.
;'''New Boss Fight: Tyl Regor'''
*Tyl Regor is back and is stronger than ever. Assassinate this skilled threat amidst the oceans of Titania, Uranus!

''(We must first hotfix for general stability before we start the event, stay tuned for 16.5.1)'''''

''Tenno,

You have the opportunity to strike at the heart of Tyl Regor’s secret cloning labs but this opportunity comes with a difficult choice.

Alad V thinks these labs contain a cure for the Infestation that riddles his body and he wants us to find it. Nef Anyo hates Alad and will do anything to keep him from becoming strong again, including destroying the cure he seeks. Both are offering to lead us to the labs.

You must decide which is the lesser of two evils.''

- The Lotus

'''HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO'''
*Visit the Grineer Ocean on Uranus.
*You must decide if you wish to help Alad V or Nef Anyo. Helping Alad V means stealing the cure for his Infestation, while helping Nef Anyo means destroying the cure.
*Locate the Pump Room. You will need to flood this facility.
*Break open the pipes to allow pumped water to flood the room then start the pumping process at the nearby console.
*Once you have activated the console, wait for the pumping process to complete. Be alert, Tenno! Enemies may attack. Keep them from interrupting the process.
*When the pumping process is finished, use the elevator to access the caves below. Enemies may be waiting, so use caution.

Your next steps will be determined by the side you have chosen:

Destroy (help Nef Anyo)
- Locate the Genetic Experiment. Attack and defeat it.
- Proceed to Extraction.

Steal (help Alad V)
- Locate two Console areas in the DNA Room. Find nearby Toxin cells and apply them to each Console to extract important information and sabotage the cloning process.
- Proceed to Extraction.

'''WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW'''
- You may choose to assist either Nef Anyo by Destroying Grineer Research Components or Alad V by Stealing Grineer Research Components.
- This Operation starts *soon* until Wednesday, May 20 at 12 p.m. EDT.

'''Credit Reimbursement'''
 
Credit Reimbursement #2 is complete. All affected Tenno will have an inbox message informing them of their reimbursement of Credits.

'''Event Fixes / Changes'''
 
'''Major Fix'''
 
'''Fixed players not receiving any credits / Operation completion if they participate in a Bursa MOA hack in a party with a player that had no Void Offerings in their inventory.  Players affected by this will be reimbursed appropriate to Credits lost through this error.'''
 
Event Scoring will now allow for the level of the Bursa to act as a multiplier for your score. The higher level the Bursa, the greater your score.
 
*Fixed Bursa MOA reinforcements not properly spawning to defend the Bursa MOA, and adjusted the levels of the enemy reinforcements.
*Bursa MOA’s radial blind cooldown has been increased from 16s to 30s.
*Bursa MOA’s radial blind range has been decreased from 90m to 15m.
*Updated various audio effects on Bursa MOA’s attacks.

*Fixed an issue that allowed you to use your Void Offerings via the Gear Menu when you were close to a Bursa. The intended way for your offering to be retrieved was via hacking the Bursa’s back panel, not by using the Gear menu. This is what lead to the majority of score-related & credit consumption bugs. Now that it is fixed, we will begin working on the reimbursement script.
*Fixed an issue where Stalker-like enemies could make the Event mission break.

'''Reimbursement Script Details'''
 
*The intent of the event was to only ever allow you risk 1 (one) Void Offering.
*The bug with the Gear menu allowed you to spend >1.
*We will  be auditing for all times when >1 Offering was claimed in any denomination (1000, 10000, 100000) and returning it to you account.

This script will take some time to write, but we will let you know when it's begun and when it's complete.

'''False Profits PSA'''

The first few hours of this event have led to immediate troubleshooting. On Prime Time we experienced one of the more commonly reported bugs, and are working on reproducing it for the next Hotfix (which will be 16.4.2).

-Currently there are other issues with the event that can lead to the following scenarios:
-Host only getting scores (witnessed on Prime Time).
-UI ‘Transfer’ Indicators only working for Hosts.
-Permanent Knockdown for Clients
-Offerings being consumed in quantities greater than 1 (we are working on reimbursement script for this)
-Errors in commands given by Lotus vs actions (killing Bursa when asked leading to failure).

If you have concise reproduction steps for an issue, please list them here in this thread.  
If you have an EE.log file that would help with a mission error (found in /%localappdata%/Warframe), please send it to support.warframe.com and post your ticket number in this thread. There is a category on the support desk for logs requested from us here in the forums. You can find it in “Logs and Metadata”, then “Files/Logs requested in Forums”.

As we monitor the attempts run on this event, we do see people are earning their Quanta Vandals already.
We are looking to ensure all the possible cases that lead to progression stoppers are resolved - your frustration is our frustration and we’ll fix things as soon as we can.

Please note that we made Clan scores larger by removing the divisor that was being applied. Positions are still the same, there are just bigger numbers now.

Anything nonconstructive will be removed as per our forum rules and guidelines.

|fixes          =
* Fixed Amprex not chaining to nearby enemies.
*Fixed Ammo Stock mod incorrectly appearing as its Prime counterpart across various UI screens.

'''TENNO REINFORCEMENT'''
 
[[Tonkor]] Grenade Launcher available now!
 
Hurl mayhem and destruction at the enemy with the Tonkor! Grenades from this Grineer launcher explode on impact. Use their blasts to propel yourself to new heights!

'''New Kubrow Mod'''
 
[[Shelter]]: Provides a shield when the owner is reviving an ally.

'''New Augment Mods'''
 
*Nekros - Shadows of the Dead - [[Shield of Shadows]]: Damage done to Nekros is shared with his Shadows.
*Chroma - Vex Armor - [[Vexing Retaliation]]: Taking a % amount of damage will trigger a % radius burst. Shield damage will cause a puncture proc while health damage will cause a blast proc.
 
'''New Conclave Mods'''
 
The following mods are only usable in Conclave:
*Nyx - Absorb - Singularity: Creates a ring every 3 seconds that drags in enemies at 9 meters per second.
 
'''Gradual Change: Diminishing Returns vs Pure Ability Immunity'''
 
For those unfamiliar with the term, diminishing returns is when an ability become less and less effective against an enemy over time. When we original designed bosses and minibosses, a lot of them had pure ability immunity making your Warframe’s abilities ineffective in battle. We’ve slowly been experimenting with ‘diminishing returns’. Many bosses and minibosses in Warframe were affected by diminishing returns, including Captain Vor, Lephantis, the Grustrag Three, and more.  Instead of being outright immune to crowd control these bosses will gain improved resistance to them with each successive use.
 
This Update expands the number of Warframe powers that fall under diminishing returns to the new Bursas. With this change we will monitor power use across each Warframe to ensure that every form of crowd control is given fair play against enemies, whether the Ability is timer-based or relies on energy drain.
 
'''New Alt Helmets!'''
 
The [[Amaru Chroma Helmet]] and [[Ovis Mesa Helmet]] are now available in the marketplace

*A ‘default colors’ button has been added to each Arsenal customization colour (instead of a full restore to default), returning a weapon, Warframe or accessory back to its default colors. This will allow your Prime Attachments to shine in the default gold we showed them with. This will fix issues issues with energy colours not showing well when you use abilities.
*Syndicate Allies can now be given ‘Hold Position’ and ‘Follow’ commands and can be issued with a context action (similar to giving Rescue targets your Secondary). This can be done at mission start as an option  for players that wish to progress in a mission alone or coordinate the movement of their Syndicate Allies. Syndicate Allies have been re-enabled in Rescue and Spy Missions in case some users want them, but if not you can have them ‘Hold Position’ at spawn and proceed alone.
*New Grineer Portrait Icons are available for purchase in the Marketplace!

With the generous assistance of several engineers from AMD we have implemented a possible workaround for a nasty crash that could occur when running multi-threaded DirectX 10 or 11 on the latest Catalyst 14.12 drivers. We are optimistic that this workaround will not only avoid the crash but may also eliminate other related problems like black-textures and other cases of memory-corruption.

At this time we would encourage all players using AMD graphics cards to update to the latest Catalyst Omega 14.12 drivers and re-enable DirectX 11 in the launcher settings.

Tenno,

My contact has informed me of a convoy of abandoned merchant vessels drifting in dead space. Seems like such a waste of good product to just leave it floating there when it could be on my shelves instead.

Reactivate the navigation consoles, and I can reroute them to a... secure location. After I take down the inventory of each ship, we can share the dividends, minus my usual finder’s fee of course.

-Darvo

Help Darvo between 3:30 p.m. EDT and Wednesday, April 15 at 2 p.m. EDT and you’ll be rewarded with the following:

'''Spy Expansion'''

Tenno,

Our scouts have returned from investigating Corpus and Grineer ships. They have discovered key details on new systemic overhauls to their data storage facilities.

Reports filed from our surviving agents show many of the classified vaults we have infiltrated have been relocated or given an extensive retrofit. Many have been upgraded to more advanced security systems. These new vaults were designed to counter forced entry. Increased patrols and movement-sensitive alarms will make infiltration difficult.

Use caution when accessing these secure data vaults. We must show our enemies there is no obscurity the Tenno cannot uncover.

*3 new Spy Vaults have been added to Corpus Spy Missions

'''PvP Balance Changes:'''<br />
The recent soft launch of Cephalon Capture has allowed us to make changes for the better from your feedback and concerns. It was clear that certain weapons/abilities/maneuvers/etc were not balanced properly for this new game mode, and we thank you for constructively helping us continue to harmonize Cephalon Capture. The following changes have been made to help create and maintain that equilibrium:
*Slide attacks in PvP will now only use the base damage of the melee weapon wielded. Previously, slide attacks used a damage multiplier; this was shifting the balance in a negative direction.

*Made adjustments to Rhino’s Charge damage in PvP.
*Arcane Helmets have been removed from PvP.
*Mods that increase maximum clip size may now be used in PvP.

'''New Quest: The New Strange'''<br />
Work with Cephalon Simaris to find the source of a mysterious voice. Something is out there, and it is hunting. Work with Simaris to track it down and discover its true nature.

'''WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW'''<br />
In order to obtain this new Quest, players above Mastery Rank 5 must first visit Cephalon Simaris in his Sanctuary after completing the Stolen Dreams Quest.  From there players can acquire The New Strange and accept it from the Codex once they return to the Liset.

'''New Warframe: Chroma'''<br />
A master of the deadly elements, Chroma can alter his damage output by changing his energy coloring.<br />
Chroma’s powers include:
*Spectral Scream:  Exhale a deep breath of elemental destruction. Chroma's energy color determines the element.
*Elemental Ward: Depending on Chroma's elemental alignment, an offensive area-of-effect is created. Chroma and its nearby allies are imbued with defensive energy.
*Vex Armor: When shields are damaged, Chroma's armor grows stronger, when health is damaged, weapon damage output increases. Active for a limited duration, the strength of this ability corresponds to rank.
*Effigy: Chroma turns his pelt into a massive sentry that strengthens nearby allies and engulfs enemies in elemental attacks.

'''New Mission: The Law of Retribution'''<br />
Tenno are out for vengeance, and Grineer Councilor Vay Hek has nowhere left to hide.  Hot on his trail after the assault on Relays during Eyes of Blight, the Lotus will guide a precision strike force to hunt down and put an end to Vay Hek once and for all.  Be wary Tenno.  Numbers alone will not protect you when diving into the heart of Grineer military power.
*Create a squad of 4 to 8 Tenno and work through three challenge scenarios as you track down Vay Hek across the Solar System.
*Earn Arcane enhancements from defeating Vay Hek, each of which provide a unique bonus Warframes can unleash during combat.
**In order to equip an Arcane enhancement players must construct it in their Foundry under the Miscellaneous tab.
**Players will then need to select what Helmet or Syandana they would like the Arcane to be attached to.
**After construction the Arcane Helmet or Arcane Syandana will appear in their Arsenal under Attachments.
*The Law of Retribution Key Blueprint is available for purchase in the marketplace for 100,000 Credits.
*This Mission can be completed with a minimum of 4 Tenno for an additional challenge.  Enemies will not scale down in difficulty with fewer players present in the Mission.

'''Conclave Syndicate, Teshin, and Cephalon Capture'''<br />
Cephalon Capture is our latest PvP game mode available on the Conclave Console in the Liset, and with its arrival come a slew of new changes to our existing PvP system.  The following are a list of general changes to PvP immediately available in Update: Sanctuary:
*Players will only be allowed to select Warframes from an existing list of warframes balanced exclusively for PvP 2.0.  This list will be expanded upon in future Updates and currently includes:
**Mag
**Chroma
**Excalibur
**Frost
**Rhino
**Volt
*Players will be limited to Weapons and Mods that have balanced exclusively for PvP.  This list will be expanding upon in future Updates.
*Players can access their unique Conclave loadouts from the Arsenal by selecting ‘Select Mode’, followed by ‘Conclave’.
*Cephalon Capture has three maps on launch that will rotate between rounds!
*Cephalon Capture now features Challenges that can be unlocked while fighting against your fellow Tenno.

With our expansion to PvP 2.0 comes a new figure to guide Tenno through the Conclave’s trials and toward the path of enlightenment.  Teshin, a survivor of the Orokin Era, disagrees with the Lotus’ policies and strives to see Tenno break free of that which restrains their potential.<br />
Teshin and the Conclave Syndicate have established their presence in the Northern Wing of any Relay, and offer unique Syndicate rewards for Tenno who represent Teshin when participating in Conclave PvP.

'''Simaris and Sanctuary'''<br />
In the cradle of space on Tenno Relays across the Solar System Cephalon Simaris has constructed a Sanctuary with the goal of eternally preserving all life.  But Simaris needs your help, Tenno.  Using Simaris’ advanced Synthesis Scanner you must track down unique targets to scan in a Codex shared by Tenno all over the world, and help unlock exciting new lore and Syndicate rewards.
*Simaris is a Neutral Syndicate and can be joined by any Tenno regardless of current Syndicate allegiance.
*Synthesis Scanners can be equipped like regular Gear, and are used in the same fashion a Codex scanner is.
*Running a Mission that features a targeted enemy will prompt a notification from Simaris, making it a little easier to hunt targets.
*Enemies scanned will be tracked by Simaris unlock a global Codex of lore, in addition to providing affinity toward Simaris’ unique Syndicate rewards.
*While playing in Missions Rare Spawn enemies with unique abilities may appear.  These enemies will be more difficult to scan, and Synthesis can have dangerous side-effects on targets scanned.
*Scanning targets will earn affinity with Simaris, and earning affinity with Simaris will not decrease Standing earned with other Syndicates.

Survival Mission PSA
 
Tenno,
 
Through our gameplay this evening as well as reports coming in from players, there appears to be a bug affecting the displayed reward vs. actual received reward in Survival Missions.
 
We noticed this when the UI said one thing (Forma), then we ended up with something else in the end-of-mission screen (Paris Prime Lower Limb). 
 
We are currently investigating this issue and will have it fixed ASAP!
 
Thanks for your patience, it’s very appreciated. More than you know!

'''New Quest: Stolen Dreams'''
 
What are the Arcane Codices?
 
A new character and a completely revamped version of Spy Mode await you in the Stolen Dreams Quest. Embrace your inner secret agent, Tenno!
 
The Grineer have put out a capture order for a thief named Maroo – they claim she double crossed them and has sold precious Arcane Codices to the Corpus. Concerned for Maroo’s safety – and excited at the idea of a new Arcane Codex – the Lotus is requesting that you bring Maroo in.
 
Think fast, Tenno! You must plan your actions quickly and accordingly in this Quest. Failure to do so may alert the enemy to your presence and the Arcane Codex data may be destroyed.
 
Complete this Quest and you’ll be rewarded with an Ether Dagger Blueprint and a Catalyst Blueprint.
 
This new Quest is available for all players Mastery Rank 3 or greater.
 
'''Spy 2.0'''<br />
While our old Spy game mode certainly had small spy-like focus in stealing intel, most of the time players were happy to loudly murder their way through the enemy to get the job done.  Who could blame anyone?  That’s why we sat down and gave Spy a total overhaul.
 
With new elements focused on avoiding laser grids and sneaking past guards, stealth is paramount in Spy 2.0.  Being detected will mean losing rewards and bonus Affinity, even when the Mission is complete.  
 
The following nodes have been updated to include this new Spy game mode:
*Mercury - Suisei
*Venus - Vesper, Unda
*Mars - Martialis
*Jupiter - Adrastea
*Saturn - Titan, Aegaeon
*Uranus - Umbriel, Rosalind
*Neptune - Sao, Laomedeia
*Pluto - Oceanum
*Ceres - Lex, Hapke
*Eris - Cyath, Gnathos
*Sedna - Tikoloshe, Scylla
*Europa - Armaros, Valac
*Phobos - Grildrig, Shklovsky

'''Stealth Finisher/Affinity Updates:'''<br />
Joining our updated Spy 2.0 are some exciting improvements to stealth combat!  Players will now find that sneaking around each Mission may come with some excellent rewards.  These alterations to stealth gameplay will continue to evolve based upon player feedback, but for now stealth aficionados can sink their teeth into the following changes:
*Stealth Streaks are here! Stealth kills can now receive Affinity multipliers if done in succession.  Players will have 30 seconds from one stealth kill to the next to increase their Affinity multiplier, which goes up to 5x for melee and 2x for Ranged!  
*Finisher damage will now increase based on weapon rank and enemy level. Finisher Damage for stealth kills capped at 8x damage with max rank melee weapon!
*The UI will inform you of your Stealth Streak where buff timers are usually located!

'''General Improvements:'''<br />
We’ve made a wide variety of improvements to Warframe in some obvious, and not-so-obvious ways.  The following is a quick list of changes we’ve made, and where you’ll notice them the most!
*Lip Sync Improvements:  The Lotus, and many other characters you see in Transmissions, have had graphical improvements made to their lip sync animations.
*Dynamic Exposure:  Light sources change the way we perceive our surroundings, potentially turning a well-lit cave into a menacing cavern.  Our new Dynamic Exposure will help better the immersion in Warframe, making the light sources in game far more real as you traverse environments. Seeing a consistent image across broad range of game lighting is biggest benefit of this new Dynamic Exposure!                                                                    
*Ambient Occlusion:  Just like how Dynamic Exposure will change the way light is perceived in Warframe, Ambient Occlusion will do the same for shadows.  By using this more intelligent shading and rendering technique we’re furthering our work on more realistic lighting, and the differences in levels with heavy or varied light sources should be quite apparent!
*Particle System 2.0 for non-Nvidia cards: For a long time Warframe’s awesome particle effects have been locked behind Nvidia-specific graphic cards -- no more!  All players should notice some increased particles attached to Warframe Abilities, and other in-game effects.
*Reverb 2.0: Just like Dynamic Exposure will change the way we see light sources in game, Reverb 2.0 will add another layer to Warframe’s immersion.  Now enemies shouting at you down long hallways will echo, and weapon fire in open amphitheatres will sound much more pronounced as the sound bounces off walls.  This system is still a work in progress, but if you happen to hear a dramatic increase in sound quality then you know the reason why!
*General PBR Updates:  PBR graphical updates have been slow and steady these past few months.  From weapons to Warframes and environmental textures we’ve put a lot of work into making every part of Warframe that much more visually stunning -- and we have no plans of stopping.  More PBR updates will continue over the following months, so if your Orthos or Boltor Prime happens to be looking a bit sleeker it’s not just you.

'''Rebalanced Mission Nodes'''<br />
The following Mission Nodes on the Star Chart have had missing and mismatched rewards fixed.
*Ceres - Bode (Capture)
*Phobos - Limtoc, Todd (Capture)
*Uranus - Trinculo (Capture)
*Europa - Valefor (Excavation)
*Europa - Zagan, Morax (Exterminate)
*Eris - Viver (Hive)
*Sedna - Undine (Sabotage)
*Europa - Gamygyn (Sabotage)

In addition, changes have been made for Defense, Survival, Mobile Defense, Exterminate and Rescue.  Previously these Missions were not properly balanced to reflect the Mission's enemy levels, sometimes resulting in fewer enemies than intended in higher level Missions and more at lower level Missions.

'''Survival Spawning Update'''<br />
To simulate waves and grouped up enemies, previously survival enemy spawns cycled on and off for short periods of time.  While it was a simple way of adding the desired pacing, we found that it was possible for players to get 'in sync' with killing enemies at certain times which left gaps of time where there were no enemies to kill and no enemies spawning, especially in higher level Missions with four players.

Spawning now fluctuates dynamically with each enemy spawned.  Max spawn rate is the same, but it's now the time between individual enemy spawns which changes instead of a blanket 'on' or 'off' state for all enemy spawning.  Hopefully you will start to see more consistent spawning in higher level Missions with four players, as well as squads of enemies attacking together.  In our tests we found that there wasn't a notable difference in low level Missions.
*Small life support drop rate was tweaked to compensate for the changes.
*Although we have playtested extensively, we are always interested in your feedback.  Please be sure to let us know how these changes may have affected your gameplay experience in the appropriate subforum: [https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/forum/237-mission/ here]

Star Chart node changes have been made to balance the available nodes across factions, tilesets and difficulty.  The following nodes have received changes:
*Saturn - Keeler: Changed Survival node to Grineer Asteroid Mobile Defense
*Saturn-  Cassini: Changed to Asteroid tileset (was Galleon)
*Phobos - Flimnap: New Survival Grineer Asteroid node (was Deception)
*Europa - Zagan: New Survival Corpus ship (was Exterminate)
*Neptune - Despina: New Survival Corpus ship (was Defense)
*Ceres - Nuovo: Changed to Galleon tileset (was Shipyards tileset)

'''Tenno Shields Update'''<br />
Shields and HP are two critical elements to keep track of in Warframe, but when fighting enemies it can be difficult to keep track of how much damage you’ve taken in the heat of combat.  This Update contains new visual and audio cues for when your Warframe takes damage in combat.  

When taking damage in combat damage will sound different depending on if your shields are down or intact.  Additionally shields ‘breaking’ have a new audio cue to help you better keep track of when your health is exposed to enemy fire.

'''Additional Sound Adjustments'''<br />
This Update includes multiple improvements to sound immersion.  Among these changes are:
*Improved audio on bullet impact, making it easier to hear where shots as passing by (or where your rounds are being spent).
*Improvements to the Grakata's audio.
*Sliding will now provide different sound effects, depending on what surface the player is on.

'''Enemy Accuracy Adjustments:'''<br />
There are a lot of variables that go into making an NPC more or less deadly, and accuracy plays a huge role in what enemies are most feared.  These new adjustments to enemy accuracy will dramatically change how players handle foes.

Each enemy will have increased (or decreased) odds of hitting a player based on the type of weapon they’re using.  Sniper rifles, for example, will have higher accuracy at long range but will be more difficult for NPCs to use in close-range combat.  Not only that, but our new system allows us to create custom draw rates that make some weapons more difficult for enemies to aim quickly with.

These changes represent an ongoing state of development for our NPC accuracy; and we welcome player feedback on this subtle, under-the-hood change to be made in the appropriate subforum.  For more information on our accuracy adjustments please check the following thread in our Developer Workshop: [https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/395422-npc-accuracy/ here]

*Auto-turrets will now be open on spawn.

'''Syndicate Changes:'''<br />

**MR 2 could earn 6000 Standing before, now 3000.

Network Compression and Congestion Control changes are being made to Warframe!  What does this mean for the average player?  The tl;dr is that better Network Compression means lower latency during Missions, and a lot less stress on your bandwidth!<br>
If you’d like to know more about the technical side of this exciting update, please read the full explanation: [https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/391492-network-compression-and-congestion-control/ here]

'''Strict NAT Improvements:'''<br>
Strict NAT is a problem that affects a small portion of our playerbase, but for friends that want to play together having multiple layers of Strict NAT can be an issue.  Earlier this week (and with more work in this update) we’ve begun to test a solution that will help players suffering from Strict NAT better connect with friends without needing to worry about their own network configurations.<br>
For more on this exciting update, please read the full explanation of our NAT testing: [https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/391742-strict-nat-improvements-and-testing/ here]

'''Syndicate Syandanas are now available!'''<br>
Each glows more intensely with achieved feats achieved in mission.<br>
Wear your accomplishments and allegiance with pride by donning these six new Syndicate Syandanas!<br>
The Telos, Synoid, Sancti, Secura, Asita Raka and Vaykor Syandanas glow with increased intensity as different accomplishments are achieved in missions
*TELOS SYANDANA - With every enemy struck down the Telos Syandana glows stronger.
*SYNOID SYANDANA - The Synoid Syandana glows more brightly with every scan performed.
*SANCTI SYANDANA - The Sancti Syandana pulses every time the Tenno uses an ability and continues to strengthen with each ability used.
*SECURA SYANDANA - This Secura Syandana pulses every time a Tenno picks up credits and glows brighter as their wealth increases.
*ASITA RAKTA SYANDANA - This Asita Rakta Syandana ignites a jet of flames that burns brighter with each stealth takedown.
*VAYKOR SYANDANA - The Vaykor Syandana flares up whenever the Tenno takes damage.<br>

*Ember is now able to gain energy from Team Energy Restore items while her World on Fire Ability is toggled on. Please note Energy Orbs should be working as well. Our tests confirm Energy Orb pickups give the expected energy to Ember while World-on-Fire is active, if you encounter an issue where this isn’t the case please outline the repro specifics in the appropriate bug sub-forum.
*Ember’s World on Fire will immediately hit up to five targets on initial cast.
*Ember’s World on Fire will now drain energy after casting has been completed, and not during cast.  Energy drain will deactivate the moment the Ability has been toggled off, regardless of animation state.
*Ember’s World on Fire will now prioritize targets on activation.  Higher priority will be given to targets that pose the most immediate threat to Ember, such as not under any Crowd Control or within close range.
*Ember’s World on Fire will now have an increased chance to proc fire damage on enemies (chance increased by strength mods).

*More recent Corrupted Mods were given an increased drop chance to give players better odds at being able to get them.  Now that some of the shine has worn off, all Corrupted Mods are being given the same % drop chance.  This means you’ll now have an equal shot at any Corrupted Mod on your Vault Runs!

Update 15.8.0: Operation Eyes of Blight
 
OPERATION EYES OF BLIGHT
 
Take down the Fomorian Vessels!
 
A message from the Lotus:
 
Vay Hek is making his move. We have just detected a Balor Fomorian traveling on an interception course with Vesper Relay. The beast moves slowly but if we allow it to get within firing range, it will surely obliterate our new Relay. We need to destroy it before that happens.
Intelligence reports state that the Balor Fomorian’s power core emits a thick energy field composed of deadly omega radiation. In order to break through the field you will need to craft this Fomorian Disruptor. It will allow you to safely approach the core and when activated it will temporarily disrupt the core allowing you to inflict damage.
Take note Tenno, the Disruptor is forged using recently discovered Omega Isotopes. These are a by-product of a Fomorian’s core and will only appear in and around planets with a Fomorian present.
Move quickly Tenno, this is the first Balor Fomorian attack but it won’t be the last. When the others come we must be ready.
 
- The Lotus
 
HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO
 
*Fomorian Vessels will intermittently appear in the Solar System as event nodes. These event nodes will be locked until you have the Fomorian Disruptor in your Consumable Inventory.  
*You will receive a Blueprint from the Lotus for the Fomorian Disruptor. It will require Nano Spores, Cryotic, and Omega Isotopes to craft.  
*Build your Disruptor in the Foundry and equip it in your Gear Menu to start the Fomorian Sabotage Mission.
*Once in the Mission, fly to the Fomorian. Once you’re close enough to the Fomorian you must disable the exterior Shield Cores so you can enter the ship.  
*The Fomorian’s internal Shield Generators are protected by a magnetic field. Use your Fomorian Disruptor from the Gear menu to disrupt the magnetic field, and temporarily expose the Shield Generators, allowing you to destroy them.
*With the Shield Generators destroyed you can now deal damage to the ship’s Main Reactor Power Cores.  
*After damaging the cores, escape to safety outside the Fomorian.
 
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
 
*Completing a successful Sabotage run will earn you event points, and reduce the global health of the Fomorian.
*Your Fomorian Disruptor will be consumed after completing the Fomorian Sabotage mission.
*This Operation is on now until Monday, January 5 at 12 PM EST.
 
SCORING  
 
*Completing the Fomorian Sabotage mode successfully will earn you one Battle Point. 
*You can earn a maximum of one Battle Point per Fomorian. Repeating the same Fomorian will not generate additional Battle Points. These points will count towards individual rewards.
*Fomorian missions with a higher level of difficulty will provide extra points.
*Leaderboards are available for players that want to compete for the best score during Fomorian Sabotage Missions. Your individual score is determined by the amount of damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core during a single run. The highest scores can only be achieved by squads with coordinated deployment of Fomorian *Disruptors, and efficient attacks on the Power Cores.
 
*Clan Scoring considers the following:
 
Your score will be based on the most damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core in a given mission. Clan score is sum of personal best but divided by max clan size for that tier (ie: 10 for Ghost Clan, 1000 for Moon).                                                                                                                                                                   
 
REWARDS
 
 
3 BATTLE POINTS: Eyes of Blight Skin Pack (Badge + Rahk Fluctus Skin)
10 BATTLE POINTS: Eyes of Blight Mod Pack (Magma Chamber + Searing Steel)
15 BATTLE POINTS: Imperator Vandal
 
Clan Scoring: The Top three Clans in each tier will be awarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze Statues.
Take down the Fomorian Ships, Tenno!
 
EVENT / LEADERBOARDS - Operation Eyes of Blight
 
 
Players can check out the Leaderboards for Operation Eyes of Blight: [http://content.warframe.com/dynamic/eyesOfBlight.php here]
 
Leaderboards are updated every 15 minutes for Clans, and every 5 minutes for players.  Good luck, and may the best Tenno win!
 
New Resource
Omega Isotopes: Produced by a Fomorian’s power core, these particles only appear on planets where a Fomorian is present.  Omega Isotopes can only be obtained in non-Archwing missions where a Fomorian vessel is present.<br><br>

|title          =Tenno Reinforcements: Kohm and Tenno Relays
|image          =KohmSplashArt.jpg
|misc           =
'''Tenno Reinforcement:'''<br>
Kohm:  The Kohm is a primary plasma shotgun with a unique held-trigger function.  For every shot fired in rapid succession the Kohm releases an additional bolt, growing more lethal with every pull of the trigger!

'''Tenno Relays are now open to all!'''<br>
These past few weeks many of our Founders, Prime Access supporters, and players with Mastery Rank 10+ have had the opportunity to help us test what our Relays were capable of handling.  With our preliminary testing of Tenno Relays coming to a close we invite all Tenno to take part in our next phase, keeping in mind that Relays may still experience some adjustments over the coming weeks.

Please be aware that there may still be some fine tuning that needs to be done in making Relay Stations a safe place for Tenno to congregate.  Rest assured we will notify everyone immediately of any downtime Relays may require during this time. 

If you discover any bugs during your exploration of these Relays please help us squash them by reporting all issues to the following: [https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/363241-relays-known-issues/ this thread]

To make Tenno Relays a little easier to navigate, here’s a list of currently available features that range from brand new content to tips that will help make your stay on the Relay a little more pleasant:
*Relay Stations are available on many planets, and are a great way to meet other Tenno looking to complete Missions in that sector.
*Players can create or join a squad while inside the Relay, then use the Relay’s Mission Control in the Northern Wing to start a mission.
*Players can also alter their loadout in Mission Control, should they need a different build for a more specialized mission.  These changes will reflect to other nearby Tenno.
*Each Syndicate has their own room on Tenno Relays, and are more than happy to trade their usual rewards in-person instead of through the Liset’s console.
*Syndicate rooms each have a special representative that collects Medallions, a new Currency for earning Standing.
*Various art and lighting updates have been made to Tenno Relays!  Be sure to explore and take in the new look and explore each of the multiple floors available in the Concourse.
*Various NPCs within Tenno Relays will be a little more lively now that they have animations.

'''Void Trader'''<br>
Baro Ki’Teer is a man of rare and luxurious tastes, willing to trade a wide variety of his acquired goods in exchange for the unique items that Tenno often discover when traveling the Void.  While he is often in demand his appearance on a Relay is rare, heralded by Ducat Kiosks in the main Concourse.
*Players can trade in unused Prime parts for Orokin Ducats, the only currency that Baro Ki’Teer accepts.
*Orokin Ducats can be traded to Baro Ki’Teer alongside a sum of credits for unique Mods, weapons, and cosmetic items.
*Baro Ki’Teer’s presence on a Relay Station is random limited to only a few days.
*Some of Baro Ki’Teer’s goods are tradable with other Tenno.

'''Darvo’s Market'''<br>
While exploring the Relay Tenno may discover Darvo’s Market, which is sadly not open for business at this time.  Even still, Darvo is never one to turn down a good opportunity to advertise!  Be sure to say hello should you stumble upon his developing storefront.

'''New Syndicate Medallions'''<br>
Medallions are now available on Syndicate Missions.  Medallions act like their own currency, similar to Credits.  Each Syndicate’s Medallion may have their own unique look, but regardless of their appearance all Medallions count toward the same currency pool: Standing!  

When you’re ready to turn in Medallions simply head to your Tenno Relay of choice, visit your Syndicate trader and select how many you wish to turn in.  Different ranks of Medallions can provide greater Standing than others; so keep an eye out for Medallions and plan ahead when you spend them, Tenno.

'''New Warframe Mod Augments:'''<br>
We’ve been working with our Design Council to put more Augments together, as well as adding some of our own! The following Mod Augments are now available through the Syndicate Offerings:
*Ash: Shuriken: '''Seeking Shuriken:''' Hits expose weaknesses on enemies, reducing their armor by 35%/45%/55%/70% for 2/4/6/8 seconds

*Hydroid: Tidal Surge: '''Tidal Impunity:'''   Clears procs and grants proc immunity for x seconds for yourself and allies that come in contact with it for 3/4/5/6 seconds.

*Saryn: Molt: '''Regenerative Molt:'''  After casting Molt, Saryn regenerates a percentage of health over time. Lasts 8 seconds, with healing occurring every 2 seconds.
*Trinity: Link: '''Abating Link:'''  Reduces armor by 15%/20%/25%/30% on enemies targeted by Link.
*Valkyr: Rip Line: '''Swing Line:'''  After using Rip Line, the next 1/2/3/4 rip lines while remaining airborne will have no energy cost.
*Vauban: Bastille: '''Repelling Bastille:'''  When at max capacity, has a 50%/65%/80%/100% chance to repel new enemies that enter the radius.
*Volt: Speed: '''Shocking Speed:'''  Enemies touched while sprinting under the effects of speed will take 75/100/125/175 electrical damage with a guaranteed proc.
*Zephyr: Turbulence: '''Jet Stream:''' Turbulence increases movement by 15%/20%/25%/30%  and projectile speed by 50%/65%/80%/100%  for Zephyr and her allies.

'''New Game Mode:'''<br>
'''Corpus Hijack is now live on Sorath-Europa!'''<br>
The Corpus have begun salvaging their crashed ships on Europa for valuable goods, loading up heavy all-terrain vehicles with cargo for shipment off planet.  Their most treasured shipment of recovered goods has just been readied for extraction, and it’s your job to make sure those secrets go to Tenno hands.
*Locate the Corpus shipment, then guide it safely to extraction through the frozen remains of a Corpus ship’s crash site.
*The Corpus shipment’s vehicle has been re-routed to draw power from Warframe Shields.  Defending the shipment (and one another) from weapon’s fire is the key to victory.

'''Operation: Mutalist Incursions
Stop the Infestation!'''

A message from Alad V:

''“Inhabitants of the Origin System! It is my singular pleasure to announce that today is the first day of a new empire. An empire populated not by Corpus, not by Grineer and certainly not by the Tenno. No, the Mutalist Empire will be populated by you. A glorious new you, baptised by Mutalist flesh. You’ve called this a disease, an infestation? I call it Unity. One army under me. Welcome you to your new species.”''

– Alad V

[[File:Operation-Mutalist-Incursions-splash.jpg|frame|center]]

'''Mutalist Incursions:'''
*The Infested are taking over areas of the Solar System. You must try to stop them, Tenno!
*You will receive an Inbox message from the Lotus with instructions on how to earn the Bounty for four different Infested enemies – Tar Mutalist MOAs, Swarm Mutalist MOAs, Brood Mothers and Boilers.
*Infested Alerts will begin appearing in the Solar System. Visit the areas of the Solar System that are under attack to take down the Infested and earn the required amount of enemy kills for each of the four Bounties.

'''WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW'''
*Each Infested you take down will contribute a point to your Bounty totals.

Required totals:
:Tar Mutalist MOA: 100
:Swarm Mutalist MOA: 100
:Brood Mother: 50
:Boiler: 50

*Upon completing each Bounty, you will receive a Reward.
*This event is on now and ends on Wednesday, December 3 at 12 PM EST.

'''REWARDS'''<br>
Complete all four Bounties to unlock access a special Survival Mission! How long can you Survive? Make it past 30 minutes and you’ll be rewarded with a New Puncture Mod Set!

Clans can compete on this Survival mission for the leaderboards! The top 3 clans in each tier will receive a Trophy.
The Tethra’s Doom Mods are also available as drops in this event within the Survival Mission.

Tenno…the more familiar you become with these enemies, the better you’ll fare against Alad V. Get out and take down the Infested, Tenno!

'''Mesa: The Gunslinger'''<br>
Ballistic Battery: When activated, this power stores damage caused by guns. When triggered again, that damage is channeled through the next gunshot.

Shooting Gallery - Gives an ally extra damage while jamming the guns of nearby enemies. This power shifts between team members.

Shatter Shield - Envelops Mesa in a barrier of energy, reflecting back incoming bullet damage.

Peacemaker - With intense focus, Mesa draws her Regulator pistols, shooting down her foes in rapid succession.

*Obtain Mesa through defeating Mutalist Alad V!
*Longhorn Mesa Alt Helmet can be found in the Market today!

'''Mutalist Alad V!'''

'''New Quest: Patient Zero'''

'''New Boss: Mutalist Alad V'''<br>
Consumed entirely by Infestation, Alad V has thrown the Solar System into turmoil using his new Infested experiments. Be warned, Tenno – Alad V is the likely cause of this new outbreak and must be stopped at all costs. Use the deadliest tools at your disposal to bring down the renegade Corpus madman!

You can encounter Alad V by beginning the PATIENT ZERO Quest. This Quest will take you through the steps to locate and fight what Alad V has become! Find Mutalist Beacons through Infestation Outbreak rewards. The Lotus needs 3 Beacons to triangulate Alad V’s position.

'''New Weapons'''<br>
*New Melee Weapon: Redeemer. Striking with massive twin blades, the Redeemer fires the killing blow with its built-it shotgun.<br>
*New Weapon: Gammacor. Designed to quickly vaporize minerals for content analysis, users discovered its powerful beam was equally efficient at dispatching hostiles.<br>
*New Weapon: Paracyst. Completely overwhelmed by Infested biology, this former Quanta now fires organic ordinance and a harpoon like appendage.<br>
*New Archwing Weapon: Dual Decurion. Delivering twin streams of highly accurate, rapid-fire ordinance, the Decurion are specifically designed for combat in the vacuum of space.<br>

:New Syndicate Weapons: Each weapon has an adjusted stat and built-in Justice / Truth / Entropy / Sequence / Purity / Blight to better reflect its Syndicate’s nature.
:*Steel Meridian: Vaykor Marelok
:*Arbiters of Hexis: Telos Akbolto
:*Cephalon Suda: Synoid Gammacor
:*Perrin Sequence: Secura Dual Cestra
:*New Loka: Sancti Castanas
:*Red Veil: Rakta Ballistica

Offer standing to your Syndicate of choice to obtain these new Syndicate-specific weapons!

'''New Melee Stances:'''<br>
Redeemer: High Noon. Bullets spray between wicked slash attacks.

'''New Infested Enemies:'''<br>
:New Enemy - Tar-Mutalist Moa: Discharges tar-like mucus slowing its prey.
:New Enemy - Swarm-Mutalist Moa: Discharges swarms of infested spores.
:New Enemy - Brood Mother: Spawns maggots that attack its target.
:New Enemy - Maggot: Overwhelms prey with sheer numbers.

*Fixed Oberon’s Hallowed Ground removing proc immunity when exiting one strip, but still on another (overlapping strips) as seen [http://goo.gl/xZ0ymP here]
*Fixed an issue where previous Mission Complete UI from last completed mission will always appear when aborting other missions.
*Fixed an issue where pet Kubrows would remain on damage-dealing surfaces like electric water. Kubrows now jump off these surfaces!
*Fixed an issue with overlapping UI elements when selecting ‘Abort’ in spectator mode.

*Fixed issues with physics and effects of Excalibur’s Pendragon Helmet.
*Fixed an issue where players would have no indication of XP progress on failed or aborted missions.
*Fixed an issue where mods that improve reload time were showing as red numbers in UI where they should have been green - lower reload time is good!
*Fixed a number of Void water volumes that were off and misaligned as prompted by [http://goo.gl/6iv3QP this thread]
*Fixed an issue with the Grineer Commander not always using his Switch Teleport ability.
*Fixed an issue where there would sometimes be no ‘Exit’ button in the mission results screen.
*Fixed an issue with Excavators not appearing when a player enters the objective area.
*Fixed an issue with only the most recent Excavator showing on the UI, preventing players from knowing the status of multiple Excavators.
*Fixed a number of problems with the Codex Scanner (including Helios’s user of the Scanner):
**Fixed handling of certain compound objects like Death Orbs (you could not scan them and neither could Helios).
**Fixed over-scanning from within a mission (it used to only realize you were done an entry at the end of the mission).
**Fixed Helios refusing to scan decorations while there were scannable objects out of sight.

*These fixes have also brought about the following optimizations:
**Changed Helios to reduce time between scans (often over 3 seconds was wasted).
**Simplified Helios' scan logic to avoid a bunch of heavy-lifting that is already done by native code.
*Further code optimizations.

'''OPERATION GATE CRASH'''

Keep Grineer out of the Void!

A message from The Lotus:

Tenno,

We have reviewed Baro Ki’ Teer’s Archwing Datamass, much of it is corrupt but what little it does reveal is invaluable. We now know that more information exists and we must look for it in Orokin Derelicts locked in the Void.

Our mission is urgent. The Grineer have also learned about the Archwing Technology and they are determined to destroy all traces of it before we find it. To do this, Vay Hek is using Void Keys and Torsion Beam Generators to force open Orokin portals.
We must destroy his access to these portals. Our ability to recover Archwing fragments depends on it.
Careful, Tenno. Vay Hek is using unstable keys. Cumulative exposure to the keys will have detrimental effects on your health, shields and Warframe abilities. Proceed accordingly.

The Lotus
 
''HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO''
* Start the event node on Earth.
* Play through the mission, defeat the Grineer bosses and destroy the Void Portal Key.
* If you want to take the risk, search out resource caches to find high-value items.
* Exposure to the Void Portal will begin to affect you. Exposure weakens your Warframe. The effects are cumulative – the more missions you run, the weaker you become.
* Each mission run you will earn 1 Exposure point.
* More Exposure points earned = higher Rewards.
* Earn 5 Exposure points on a node to unlock a new node.
* Nodes to unlock (in order):  Phobos, Ceres, Challenge Node located back on Phobos.
* The Challenge Node has no Exposure point cap. Keep earning Exposure points for as long as you are capable --- know that your Warfame will be in an extremely weakened state the further you progress.
 
''WHEN''
* This Operation is on now until Wednesday, September 24 at 12 PM EDT.

''REWARDS''
Successfully complete the Mission and you'll be rewarded with:
* 5 Exposure points: Event Badge and Phobos node unlocked
* 10 Exposure points: Set of 4 Mods – [[Buzz Kill]], [[Fanged Fusillade]], [[Sweeping Serration]] and [[Maim]]
* 15 Exposure points: [[Sheev]] Dagger: Built for close combat, the Sheev's plasma blade slices through flesh and armor with equal ease.
*The top 3 Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze Trophies.
* Clan Leaderboards: A Clan’s score is the sum of its members’ scores.

Please be aware that people joining clans after the event has started will not contribute to their new clans score.

** Progress bar of tutorial stage

|additions      =
*Added Rank display to item browsing, meaning you can now see what rank your gear is in the inventory. As an example, in the scenario of building an Aklex and you have three, one which is Rank 30, you can now see the item's rank in this new display!
*Unlisted 14.6.0 change: There is now a Dojo chat tab when in the Dojo!
|changes        =<br>

'''Trinity:'''
*Trinity's Blessing is now recastable while passive damage reduction is active. This means you no longer need to wait for your Duration timers to expire before being able to recast Blessing.

'''Excalibur:'''
*Firstly, an explanation in intent and next steps:
**Dev observed and experienced the uninhibited blinding effect in up to a 60 M Range with several environments coming between Excalibur and targets. This prompted review.
*Secondly, the 14.6.0 changes have all been reverted as they were experimental and not intended to function in the way they did for this brief 12 hour window.
*Thirdly, what you can expect down the road is Radial Blind functioning in a way that considers Line-of-sight. The 14.6.0 unintended version suffered from a lot of problems with this approach, and coming will be radically improved line-of-sight checks for Radial Blind. Targets behind cover that can still see Excalibur are blinded. Other bodies won’t inhibit their blindness, but walls will.
 
'''Rage Mod:'''
*First, a quick brief in the history of changes this Mod has undergone:
**This Mod was originally fixed to not give a player energy for damage that was never dealt to player. When we added the damage predeath state in Conclaves, etc, the original fix was unintentionally reverted.
*The 14.6.0 fix resolves issues where Rage + Quick Thinking gave effective permanent invulnerability because energy was being added to pool that was never dealt to player. With this change in mind, the combination of Rage and Quick Thinking may seem less efficient as before due to no longer giving effective invulnerability. The scope of this change is being monitored to ensure the usefulness of these Mods as a combination.
 
'''Other Changes:'''
*Changed loading screen/matchmaking logic to move on if after 10 seconds Client is unable to properly join/connect. Elaboration: Fixes entire squad being stuck on loading screen while waiting for low end PC to load.
*Changed the attack ferocity of Corpus Mine Osprey: before no maximum existed on number of deployed mines, and now there is a maximum of 6.
*Removed Kubrow roaming in Liset until further notice.
*Tweaked performance of Local Reflections code on Dx10 and Dx11 to address potential FPS loss.
*PvP Bladestorm balancing:
**Reduced maximum number of attacks to [2, 3, 4, 5] to address issues with players getting stuck in Bladestorm-ed state for up to 15+ hits.
**Increased the PvP damage multiplier from 0.1 per hit to 0.5 per hit in an effort to keep damage output in line with previous values.
|fixes          =
*Fixed issue with Captain Vor being unbeatable on Mercury.
*Fixed an issue with Nova’s Molecular Prime explosions caused by self-destructing enemies damaging teammates and defense objectives.
*Fixed issues with users connecting behind proxies being unable to update the game.
*Fixed an issue where Lotus would constantly talk to you at the end of Survival Alerts.
*Fixed a game freeze that would occur when attempting to fuse or change mods.
*Fixed game freeze when focusing on the categories menu after opening the item browsing screen in Foundry.
*Fixed interception console ‘hitswitch’ pushing AI through the terrain on Grineer maps.
*Fixed navigation issues that prevented faithful Kubrow from joining in the fight against Lephantis.
*Fixed issues with Void missions not pausing when playing Solo and hitting ESC.

'''OPERATION CRYOTIC FRONT'''
Dig for valuable Artifacts! 
 
A message from a Mystery Associate:
 
Tenno,
 
I do hope you will forgive my concealed identity but dealing in these unsavoury circles demands unusual discretion.
I’m such a big fan of the Tenno, you’ve accomplished so much and with such rudimentary equipment. That’s why I’m concerned about the coming Balor Fomorians. I think we both know your Warframes are simply not sophisticated enough to stop them.
But I can help you... for a price.
You see, I have an appetite for the rare and extraordinary and I’ve recently learned of a fine substance known as Cryotic. If you are willing, I will supply the necessary equipment and coordinates for its extraction. In return, I will enlighten you with what I know about technology that could defeat this Balor threat.
To sweeten the deal I am even willing award bonuses to those of you who exhibit outstanding performance.
I must say, some of you display the inklings of good taste, if our partnership is a success perhaps we will get to know each other better.
Regards,
Your New Associate
 
''HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO''
*Play the new Excavation missions! 
*The Location of a ‘Scanning Device’ will appear on your minimap for you to locate. 
*Collect Power Cells dropped by enemies, and bring them to the Scanner to activate it and keep it powered. You can track your Scanner’s power in the map on your HUD. If it reaches 0%, the process will stall until power is restored.
*Defend the Scanner as it searches for a dig site. Once the Scanner has found a site, it will appear on your map. Proceed to that location to find an Excavator that is digging for artifacts.
*Take caution!  Enemy waves will attempt to destroy the Excavator, and you must defend it. The Excavator will also continue to lose power. As with the Scanner, you must collect Power Cells to keep it activated.
*Once the Excavator has uncovered the artifact, you may choose to Extract from the operation or wait for another Scanner and repeat the process.
*There are three available Tilesets for this Operation.
*What is CRYOTIC (New Resource)?
Usually found in extreme sub-zero environments, Cryotic instantly freezes anything it comes in contact with. 
 
''WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW''
*If the Excavator is destroyed before it recovers an item, the mission is a failure.
*The Operation is on now until Wednesday, September 3 at 12 PM EDT.
*Operation Cryotic Front is the first introduction of a new mission type that will replace all Survival missions that take place on a terrestrial tileset.
*This Operation introduces Cryotic, a new resource that will only be available in the Excavation game mode.  
*At each of the point levels below and you’ll unlock a new Tileset in the Operation. It’s your choice – continue to dig on Earth or take your efforts to these new areas. Note that each new Tileset will hold more difficult enemies but will provide the opportunity to earn points faster.
 
''REWARDS''
With each successful dig, you will receive an amount of Cryotic based on your performance (100 max.) The more Cryotic you earn, the better the Reward – so dig on!
*More than 500 pts = Event Badge
*More than 1000 pts = Ice Mod Set (4 dual-stat mods)
*More than 3000 pts = Latron Wraith and the Polar Glaxion skin
 
''CLAN SCORING''
*The top three Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze Trophies. For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan’s score is the sum of active personal bests.
*Please be aware that people joining clans after the event has started will not contribute to their new clans score. 
|additions      =
*New Tileset Preview - Corpus Ice Planet! Progress with fellow Tenno in the Operation Cryotic Front event to explore the new frozen tundras! 
*New Game Mode - Excavation! This gamemode will be replacing On-Planet Survival missions.  Give it a try today and let us know what you think! This is our first pass and we’re very interested in your thoughts, please visit our Feedback megathread to add your thoughts! The objectives are: Seek out artifacts by powering scanners with power cells dropped by enemies and defend the artifact excavators for as long as you can! 
*New Weapon -  [[Glaxion]]
Fires a photon beam that halts molecular vibrations, causing instant and painful freezing.
*New Weapon - [[Kronen]]
The Kronen resurrects a lethal fighting style once thought lost to the ages. The Kronen comes with an entirely new stance, GEMINI CROSS! 
*New Weapon - [[Nukor]]
Creates and focuses a high-frequency field of microwaves literally cooking the target from within.
*New Customization - 2 color pickers! Get the Lotus colour picker and the Eximus Colour picker today! 
*New Customization - Hecate Syandana! 
*Corpus Dynamic music is here! Much like the Grineer and Infested, Corpus missions now sport their own music which is dynamically generated based on mission events!  
*Added an overhauled look for Warframe Mod cards! Find out everything you need to know about these newly designed cards here: [https://warframe.com/news/introducing-our-145-mod-update]
*Added support for DirectX 10! Please see our Developer Workshop here for more information:[https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/298460-directx-10/]
*Added support for the NAT-PMP Protocol in an effort to reduce networking problems. See our Developer Workshop for more information: [https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/298424-nat-pmp/?p=3396439#entry3396439]

**Projectiles that are spawned after impact seek-to-target, not just spawned in direction.
**Speed up projectiles by 50%.
**Forced Radiation proc on the initial target.
**Forced Knock-down on initial target instead of stumble.
**Forced Puncture proc on all enemies hit.
*Hallowed Ground:
**Allies within Hallowed Ground can not be proc’ed.
**Hallowed Ground will remove all existing procs from Allies.
**Armour boosted by 5/10/15/20% per rank for all Allies on Hallowed Ground, with stacking being explored on multiple casts.
*Renewal:
**Switch to toggle ability with smaller base cost and energy per second active drain. All Renewal benefits occur when projectile reaches target ally.
**Boost Heal amount 200/250/300/400 per rank.
**When target is fully healed, remove any active proc effects.
**Allies affected by Renewal have slowed bleedout by 20/25/35/45% per rank. This is affected by duration mods. 
*Reckoning:
**Forced Radiation Proc added to damage on targets.
**Small radial blind added to slam impact, but only for enemies that survive the damage of the cast. This radial blind will be applied to enemies that move into range after it’s been cast and are blinded by the impact of those being slammed by Reckoning!
 
''Vauban Changes: ''
*Made Vauban's Vortex scale with power range and duration mods.
 
''Nyx Changes:''
*Nyx’s Absorb has had it’s passive energy drain significantly reduced from 10 energy per second to 4 energy per second, and instead now has an energy drain based on incoming damage. This drain is 8 energy per 1000 damage. These drainage values are affected with the use of mods. 
 
''Nova Changes:''
 
*In an effort to compensate for more useful attribution of XP when triggering a chain reaction with Molecular Prime, the main XP is attributed to whoever started the chain reaction. Before, Nova would take the bulk of the attribution. Now,  the "weapon and instigator" carry through the whole explosion chain ( if Player A casts Molecular Prime and Player B blows up the room, Player B gets the kills and XP). Similarly, if Player A casts Molecular Prime to Crowd-Control and then use their slowed state to get a nice bow-shot, Player B get weapon XP.
*Fixed some of the cases where two Nova's casting Molecular Prime would have unexpected results (explosion range and strength were always determined by the Nova who cast most recently).
 
''Rhino Changes:''
*Added HUD counter for Rhino Stomp to show how much longer you have left on your CC (and how long to wait until re-stomp). 
 
''Banshee Changes''
*Banshee's Sonar, and the Enemy Radar/Sense mods ignore security cameras and turrets.
*Banshee’s Sonar now uses Energy Colour. 
 
''Saryn Changes''

*Fixed an issue where the MatchMaking drop down list was still visible in the Clan screen when opened from within the Solar Map (causing duplicate button callouts and leaving no way to change the Clan member list's sort method.)
*Fixed Infested Ancients and Grineer Scorpions from using their grapple pull ability on Saryn's Molt avatar and Loki's Decoy avatar as it would not behave well (would have them pause for a few moments, if Molt was used again it would script error and break the enemy). This also fixes a similar issue with Vay Hek’s beam-zap attack.

|title          =Tenno Reinforcements: Quanta & Dendra Armor
|image          =QuantaDenra.png
|additions      =
*New Dendra Armor: Derived from Corpus protective technologies this armor will add even more energy flare to your Warframe!
*New Quanta Weapon: Originally designed for mineral extraction on large asteroids, this tool has recently been adapted for deadly military purposes!
*The Infested have further expanded on Eris! Introducing new Infested Rescue mission with new stakes! Also on Eris are brand new Defense and Mobile Defense maps, fight through Infested Corpus ships to defend your objectives!

*Altered the layout of certain Void extraction tiles so as to allow more Warframes to properly traverse designated wall run stretches.

*Polished Infested Corpus tilesets.
*Polished Rescue tilesets.
*Tweaked the Ambient sound effects heard in Infested tilesets.
*Tweaked a number of Kubrow animations.
*The Kubrow ‘Dig’ ability has been altered so as to allow for both Health and Energy orbs to drop from a single usage of the ability, however this will only occur when the criteria for this event are met, i.e the owners health, energy, or ammo levels are low. Other loot will not be restricted by these criteria. In addition, any success chance over 100% will cause a second roll items, including Health/Energy orbs, to occur. Additionally, we’ve received clarification on the ‘Dig’ ability is as follows. The Dig ability generates items based on your needs at the time, and the amount of needed items increases as the mod is ranked. Which is to say, if you are low on health, the Dig ability will favour generating a Health orb at the time.
*Slightly increased the frequency of Ordis general notification transmission.

*Tweaked a number of Kubrow sound effects.

'''New User Experience 2.0!'''
*Any players that have an existing Warframe account that is Mastery Rank 1 or greater will be presented with two options after logging in:  Play Prologue or Skip Prologue mode.  Both options will allow players to enter the new features of Update 14, however for those who want to take part in the new player experience can do so without needing to start a brand new account.  Any newly created account or players with an account that has Mastery Rank 0 will not be given the option to skip Prologue Mode.
*Our players often tell us the difficulty in learning the Warframe essentials is too high! Warframe Update 14 brings an entirely new tutorial and new player experience that reduces the issues reported with our older system. Read on to learn how!
*New User Experience 2.0 includes a brand new tutorial mission and quest introducing players to the narrative of Warframe and a much more immersive way to learn the game controls.

*Prevent players from quick matching into already-in-progress missions if this is their first time they’re playing the selected node.

*The newest Warframe, Mirage, is obtainable through the Quest System!
*The Kubrow and Genetic Foundry, used for breeding biological specimens, are obtainable through the Quest System!
'''Player Ship'''
*Player Ships have arrived! This immersive and re-imagined space grounds players in the Solar System aboard their own personal spacecraft, the Liset!
*Introducing: Ordis! The Liset’s Cephalon - voice and guide! This new character exists as the Liset’s original operating system, and is finally functional and ready to serve the Tenno after hundreds of years of abandon.
*The Liset provides access to all major systems, menus, and components through contextual devices aboard your ship. These are unlocked via Vor’s Prize quest! If you are a veteran that chooses to bypass playing the Prologue, they will all be ready and functioning for you.
*The Player Ship has new diegetic (in-the-world) user interface and menus, with Quick Access menus available for faster access.
'''Diegetic UI'''
*Pressing the ESC button/Start on Controller will now call up Diegetic UI from the palm of your hand. Use this in missions for normal ESC menu options.
*Pressing the ESC button/Start on Controller in mission will now allow you to see “Current Mission Progress”, which shows all pickups and details of the current mission.
*Use this ESC menu in Dojo for easier access to decoration placement and editing, instead of walking over to the console every time.
*New Mission Results screen! This new screen shows all the details of your previous run! Its minimalistic appearance will be expanded on as feedback and experiences with Liset form.
'''Genetic Foundry & The Kubrow'''
*Fetch the Kubrow Quest by slaying the mechanical four-legged pest!
*The Kubrow were once pets of the Orokin, and the domesticated Kubrow can be yours through the research that you can carry out on your Player Ship on the Genetic Foundry!

'''A Region Infested: Eris!'''
*The Infested have reclaimed parts of Eris as of Update 14!
*Available game modes in the Eris region include: Hive Sabotage, Exterminate, and Survival.
'''Dark Sectors Enhanced!'''
*PSA: Deployment of Solar Rails was halted on July 15 to prepare for this Update. We will let you know when the regular Deployment schedule returns.
*New Dark Sectors Conflict has arrived! A new gameplay mode has arrived to replace the existing Solar Rails Conflict missions.  
*Choose which Clan or Alliance you wish to support and play the role of Attacker or Defender on a multi-staged objective mission.
*Up to 4 human players per side, with empty player slots auto-filled by Spectres.
*Rank up your mods while you play!
*Are you a Clan or Alliance Tacticition? Find the new SCHEMA customization area in your Orokin Lab today! Using SCHEMAs, you can customize your Clan or Alliance’s Solar Rails by selecting room orders, placing turrets and Specter spawn points! Clan and Alliance members can enter your SCHEMA and contribute to your plans! Applying your SCHEMA to rails not in a Conflict state to have them ready for the next Conflict!
*Battle Pay is now proportionate to your contributions to the mission. For the new game mode, Attackers have to destroy the "core", and defenders have to prevent that. The more damage you do (or prevent, as appropriate), the more you get paid.
|additions      =
*New Warframe: Mirage!
**Mirage, a master of illusion, Mirage confounds the enemy in a spectacle of style and power.
**If it’s Mirage you seek, you may obtain by Quest. To her powers of illusion we can attest. Within a vault, the requirements lie, as part of a dark and corrupted  infested sky.
*New Weapons!
**The AkZani: the choice weapon of Mirage, these fast-firing dual pistols deliver a deadly performance.
**Silva & Aegis: This fiery sword and shield combination perfects the balance of Tenno offense and defense prowess. In the hands of a Master, even a defensive tool like a shield can be used as a deadly weapon. This new weapon uses a brand new Stance, 'Eleventh Storm'! Created from the concept of our Melee Design Contest winner: SilverBones.
*Dynamic Music Additions:
**Dynamic Music has been added to all Grineer and Infested missions, with Corpus coming soon! The game now more ‘intelligently’ makes decisions about how to play ambient and combat music. We are using a stem approach so that players hear different parts of the music at all times!
*3 new Alt Helmets!:
**Mirage’s Harlequin Helmet
**Hydroid’s Ketos Helmet!
**Zephyr’s Tengu Helmet!
*Added friendly NPC wall running. Specters, Rescue targets and Kubrow can learn where to wall run from the players.
*Added Eximus/Leader spawn scaling to Defense missions.
*Added an extra boost to wall-run melee attacks if you channel melee.
*Added CPU performance improvements.
*Alliance Emblems have been added for Warlords/Alliance Founder to upload at www.warframe.com
*Alliance Renames are here! Sick of being called the Tootsie Roll Slammers? Now you can change to the Jawbreakin’ Jostlers!
*Added new Wall Run + Strike animations for Axe, Scythe, Staff, and Claw weapons.
*Added the ability for Founding Warlords of a clan to demote other Warlords. Please note this is only possible for clans founded after we started flagging the detail of clan Founder, which occurred shortly after Update 13.
*Added visual effect on friendly hacked Moas.
*Added the ability to Slide Jump into a wall run. Before you would just slide and jump at the wall, but now, if aimed and the correct functions pressed, this will transition into a wall run.
*Added support for additional aspect ratios.
*Added in a graphics option to disable Anisotropic Filtering. This should help with increase performance by approximately 10% on Intel HD Graphics units.
*Added an ‘accept all’ pending friend requests option as a context action under the accept friend menu.
*Added a new Animation when you use a Revive in a session.
*Added all 3 Diorama Winners from the Diorama Contest of days past! Congratulations to Casardis, 9Hopper, and FireTempest. Find the dioramas in the Codex!
|changes        =
*Saryn
**Molt has received an Art and Effects overhaul!
**Molt now removes Procs and Status Effects when cast.
*Valkyr
**Hysteria has been reworked with an entirely new animation set and sounds! Activate Valkyr’s Hysteria to play through the new combos and movement set!
**Valkyr’s Hysteria now is affected by the melee ‘combo’ counter bonuses! The higher your combo chain, the more damage Hysteria will do!
*Volt
**Volt's Electric Shield now has a countdown timer. In the case of multiple spawned shields, the time for the last spawned one will be displayed (similar to Frost's Snowglobe).
'''General Enemy Changes''':
*Scorpions will now be able to pull players who are ‘off nav’, which means on boxes or other areas off the main path.
*Enemies health is no longer capped at 65535.
'''Infested Faction Changes''':
*All Crawlers move speed has been increased.
*New animations for Infested Ancient reach attack.
*Electric Crawler Attack range fixed, now more likely to attack with his lightning.
*Lobber Crawler has new effects on his lobbed grenade, making it easier to see.
*Infested Charger move speed increased.
*Suicide Runners will no longer explode on death if killed by melee. The death explosion causes stagger, and damage scales up with their level.
*Infested Leapers: Their leaping attack can be parried to nullify the stagger. Leap damage scales with their level.
*All Ancients can pull targets (Pull can be blocked or dodged).
*All Ancients - better anticipation of knockdown attack. It can now be parried to nullify damage and the knockdown.
*Toxic Ancients - Do poison damage and gives all nearby enemies poison damage. Ancient and nearby enemies are resistant to poison and gas damage.
*Healing Ancients - Links with nearby allies, any damage they take heals the Ancient up to 150% health, and it scales up to reflect having health > 100%. Also reduces damage that nearby allies take.
*Healing Ancient now has Fossilized health, to be consistent with the other Ancients (was Infested Armour).
*Leaper infested can dodge.
*Disruptor Ancients - Aura that reduces radial and power damage taken by nearby allies. Attack damage energy, rather than completely drain it. Attacks of nearby allies have the same effect.
'''Boss Balancing Changes''':
*The following bosses have gone through a balancing pass to improve their scaling for groups of high level Tenno, we hope they are a little more challenging!
**Grustrag 3, Hyena Pack, Vay Hek, Jackal, Alad V and Zanuka, Sargas Ruk, Lephantis, and Captain Vor.
***Speaking to the Jackal, The Jackal had some additional fixes to reduce the amount of stun locking possible and also allowing him to scale better with level. The health of his legs was changed to a % of his total health, which scales up with level, making it harder to knock him into his stun state. His stun timer was also decreased while the damage required to break him out of stun early was also increased and made as a % of his total health rather than a set value.
'''Orokin Derelict Survival Specific Changes''':
*Made several changes to the Derelict Survival mission to improve spawning.
**Polished the logic for connecting procedural levels.
**Increased the number of connectors to increase play space.
**Increased spawn room chance.
**Removed tentacle traversal room (Giant open room which branches are navigated) from intermediate spawning, will only occur as dead end.
'''General Survival Changes''':
*Removed the locked door to extraction, as it only limits the available spawn locations within the first 5 minutes.
*Increased the number of small dead end rooms (caps) which can generate in place of red locked doors, providing more spawn locations for enemies.
*Added some new small cap tiles for Asteroid, Settlement, Outpost and Galleon tilesets.
*Restructured the Derelict Survival procedural level so it has more small tiles between the main areas.  There are still three larger main areas which have life support capsule spawn points.  
*The 'stacking' bug was fixed, capsules don't spawn instantly on activating a capsule if the level is full.
*The first room's capsule spawns are no longer switched off after one use.  Since the first room is reused, each level may now have 2-3 more simultaneous capsules active before it reaches capacity.  Originally the level structure was a little different, disabling spawns was intended to keep players closer to extraction after moving on from the first room.
*Added infested crawlers to survival enemy spec.
'''General changes''':
*Optimized game memory to improve stability for 32-bit systems and reduce load-times. This optimization includes up to ⅓ less data being loaded on boot.
*Completing an Alert on a node you have locked no longer unlocks the node underneath.
*Removed blood/dismembered Grineer from Excalibur's codex entry ...he didn't mean to hurt anyone.
*Increased decoration capacity in the trophy room for adequate trophy placement.
*Changes to mod art: Decisive Judgement and Tranquil Cleave used the same image, now they don’t!
*Changed Ruk’s image in the “Enemies” section of the Codex.
*Changes to visual effect when Melee killing an enemy while Channeling.
*Improved performance on effects that use the the particle system.
*Revisited Nekros tinting.
*Loki Prime's decoy now holds a Lex Prime!
*Material updates to Corpus ship hull Cores.

'''News:'''

[[Operation Breeding Grounds|Operation: Breeding Grounds!]]

{{quote|Tenno, we have a problem.

Alad V has developed a way to direct the spread of the Infestation. Using these newly engineered "Hive" organisms, the Infestation is able to corrupt a new ship or colony almost instantly. There are also disturbing reports coming in that the virus has evolved. It is now capable of absorbing and corrupting non-organic beings. Not even the robotic soldiers of the Corpus are safe now. The only way to stop the spread is to destroy these hives.

We have just received word of a massive outbreak near Eris. An entire fleet of Corpus ships has been exposed to this new bioplague. Alad V is almost certainly responsible. If Alad V's hives are allowed to gain a strategic foothold here, the Infested will become unstoppable. They will overrun the system in a matter of days. If we don’t put an end to this now, the Corpus, the Grineer, the Tenno...we could all fall in the wake of this horrible scourge.|The [[Lotus]]}}

So begins '''Operation: Breeding Grounds!'''

'''HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO'''
*Visit the threatened ship on Eris to find and destroy three separate hives. These hives greatly accelerate the spread of the Infestation.
*Each hive is protected by several tumor nodes, destroy these to make the hive vulnerable.
*Destroying the hives is likely to have unintended consequences. Be on alert for everything from unstable ship systems to Infested counter-defenses.
*Once you have wiped out all three hives, head to Extraction.

'''WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW'''
*This Operation is on until Thursday, June 26 at 12 PM EDT. 
*You can attack the three hives in any order. Work individually and attempt to destroy them all at once or work with your fellow Tenno to take them out one at a time.
*Hive effects compound, so tackling each hive will create a unique effect on your mission and the ultimate combination of all three effects during Extraction.
*With every mission you run, the Infested evolve and become more deadly.

'''TENNO, YOU WILL BE REWARDED!'''

Operation: Breeding Grounds will include point structure that allows for rewards based on points earned in ONE SINGLE mission! This will be denoted in the UI in the "Best" field under the Operations tab to help you keep track of your current best score.

*6 points: Breeding Grounds badge!
*17 points: Dual Stat Fire Mods!
*48 points: [[Prova Vandal]]!

The top 3 Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze “Breeding Grounds” Trophies! For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan’s score is the sum of the Best Point run for all members.

'''HOW DO POINTS WORK?'''

There are 6 types of Hives that yield different points depending on the difficulty of the mission and the difficulty of the hive type. Destroying hives has adverse effects and dangerous consequences. Be on alert! Each mission will contain 3 hives determined by the difficulty of the mission. You will notice a "Total" value in the UI under the Operations tab. The higher this number, the stronger the stink and more difficult the missions!

Difficulty of the mission is increased in the following way:

You will notice a "Total" value in the UI under the Operations tab. The higher this number, the stronger the stink and more difficult the missions! All Tenno will begin playing ‘Difficulty 1’ missions with ‘Difficulty 1’ hives! But, this difficulty won’t stay at ‘1’ forever. The Infested can smell the carnage of your missions and will become more and more difficult and aggressive the more Breeding Ground missions you complete. It will take several runs for the stink of the Infested to stick to you. By completing more missions, you will encounter more difficult hives and more difficult enemies! These difficulty increases will allow you to yield higher points in a single run, with endless potential if you want to compete in clan leaderboards!

Note: grouping together with other Tenno will have an affect on difficulty depending on the level of combined stench!

Enjoy! We plan on making [[Hive Sabotage]] a permanent addition to the game down the road, so let us know what you think!

'''Changes to Crit calculations:'''

We have made changes to the way Criticals work on weapons that have been modded to have a crit chance greater than 100%. You may recall the existence of ‘red crits’ from many updates ago, which occurred with no clear formula other than “Synapse!”. Here is some clarity into the new system:

The brief:

A weapon with a critical chance greater than 100% will receive 2 calculations:
:1) a guaranteed critical damage value - this normally appears as a yellow value.
:2) a secondary red crit chance based on the remaining percent- this will appear as a new RED crit if successful!

This means:
*If your rate is 125% you get one guaranteed crit and a 25% chance of a red crit.
*If this Second Crit occurs, you will see a deadly Red crit value!

'''Warframe Changes:'''

[[Ash]]
*[[Blade Storm]] has received a rework! Now when the ability is used Ash will conjure up to two separate clones which will go on the attack in addtion to the player! This will allow the player clear out large groups of enemies even quicker!

Only the most vicious survived, evolving into deadly pack hunters that now pervade Earth's dense forests. Intensely territorial, the Kubrow will attack any creature unlucky enough to cross their path.
*New weapon: [[Sybaris|SYBARIS]] - A Tenno-crafted lever action rifle, Sybaris is equal parts elegance and executioner. Find it in the Market or Tenno Research Lab today!

*Grineer Shipyard Expansion - Ceres has had further missions changed to include this tileset expansion!

*Added in a new "Auto Vault Over Obstacles" option to toggle on or off.

'''Warframe Changes:'''

'''[[Trinity]]:'''
*[[Blessing]]:  On cast, Blessing restores all shields and health. Damage reduction for the duration of the skill is now based on the greatest percentage of health healed (ie:if you have a squad with members whose health you healed 30%, 40% and 90%, all party members will receive Damage reduction at the greatest percent, 90% in this case).  This should make the use of Blessing more reactive, greatly benefiting players that pay attention and monitor party health to maximize its effectiveness.
**Reduced the time it takes for Trinity's Blessing animation to play.
*[[Energy Vampire]]:  Will now pulse one last burst from the victim when it dies, releasing any remaining energy; this should make the power useful even when the enemy is killed prematurely.

'''[[Banshee]]:'''
*[[Silence]]: Is now a radial ranged effect that moves with you. As enemies enter the radius/area, they experience a ‘sonic disturbance’ which they react to. This disturbance deafens the targets and affects their awareness.
*[[Sound Quake]]: Players can now control when to deactivate Sound Quake, with the option to toggle it on or off.  Sound Quake will consume energy per second while active.

'''[[Nyx]]:'''
*[[Absorb]]: Players can now toggle Absorb on or off.

Both toggling changes to Nyx and Banshee will give players more freedom instead of being locked in place while the rest of your team runs around.  It should also add a nice element of resource management to both Warframes, rather than being stuck in place at the cost of X energy.

'''[[Volt]]:'''
*[[Electric Shield|Shield]]: increased size of Volt’s Shield for better team usage.

'''[[Hydroid]]:'''
*[[Undertow]]: will now be toggleable.

'''[[Ash]]:'''
*[[Shuriken]] now has forced bleed proc.
*[[Blade Strom|Bladestorm]] now has forced bleed proc.
*[[Teleport]] now leaves enemy in finisher state.
*Further clone changes to Bladestorm will follow in a future update.

'''Invasion Changes:'''
*Changes to faction logic in Invasion mission on ‘homeworld’ planets. These homeworld planets are indicated by the planet description in game.
*Defender won't go into "threatened mode" until they reach somewhere between 33% to 66% ownership. At that point they engage in a more aggressive strategy to win a  majority land value on their homeworld. Once they are back to that value, they will return to normal until another “threatened mode” between 33% and 66% takes place.

'''General Changes:'''
*Reduced the amount of motion blur seen from Volt's Speed ability.

*Optimized the shading effect on very bright energy colors to help reduce any apparent color bleeding effects.
*Improved the way the Auto-Fuse algorithm would select cores for Fusion. The Auto-Fuse functionality will now attempt to calculate the most optimal amount of Mods to fuse to reduce the amount of overflow and wastage!
*The Distribute Resource button has how been separated into two separate buttons with distinct functionality. One button will be used for distributing credits and the other will be used to distribute miscellaneous items.
*Tweaked the ability and energy visuals on numerous Warframes including Rhino, Frost, Nova, Ash, Banshee, Zephyr, Vauban, Volt and Valkyr.
*Added in a better quality Swift Death Mod card image.

'''News:'''
*Helmets with stat modifications have now been removed from the Market/Alert Cycle. Previously crafted or purchased Helmets with stats have been grandfathered in and will not be affected by this change. Additional Stat-to-Stateless Helmet recipes have been added to the Market for individuals wishing to change their current stat modifying helmets to purely cosmetic versions. To coincide with this change, the ability to trade Helmets has been added into the game as well. While the possible options to execute on this change were many, we do not feel comfortable removing the stats outright from gear players have spent hours and hours waiting for via alerts or spent Platinum on. The agency is in the players hand to remove the stats, and we will monitor to decide if further steps need to be taken.

RESCUE 2.0 IS HERE!{{clr}}
To pave the way for this overhaul, we’d like to invite everyone to participate in Specters of Liberty to try out the changes, help us work out the kinks and earn some sweet rewards for your efforts. Have fun and let us know what you think.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
*Rescue Missions throughout the Star Map have been upgraded to Rescue 2.0. These missions -*and their rewards -*are a permanent addition the game.
*Be stealthy and you'll remain unseen by the enemy. Use this to your advantage to take down the Wardens and release the hostage in your own time. Killing all of the Wardens will also earn you an extra point. (See below).
*Lend the hostage your Secondary Weapon and they will help you take on the enemy.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
*The 'Specters of Liberty' Operation will utilize the New Rescue 2.0 Missions. Exclusive Operation Rewards will be awarded to Tenno that achieve point levels while the Operation is live. (See Operation Rewards below.)
*The Corpus and Grineer have upgraded their prison security. Both factions have deployed these new facilities to three different nodes. There are Easy, Medium, and Hard facilities. Access these nodes directly on the Star Chart to participate.
*You need to locate the Red Veil Hostage. They are located in a cell within the prison block.
*Hostages are protected by Corpus or Grineer Wardens. Use caution, if alerted to your presence, they will try to initiate the Execution Sequence.
*If the Execution Sequence is started, a timer appears. If you fail to rescue the hostage before the timer runs out they will be killed.

RESCUE 2.0 MISSION REWARDS
*Rescue 2.0 Mission Rewards are a permanent addition to the game. The Red Veil will always reward you for rescuing their Operatives with Specter Blueprints — Blueprints for new, deployable AI Warframes that can be used in missions or in defense of your Clan's Solar Rails.
*Your Mission Rewards will be determined by the difficulty level and number of points earned in each Mission you complete. Up to 3 points can be earned by completing the following:
**Rescue a hostage =1 point
**Don't set off the kill switch =1 point
**Kill all Wardens =1 point
*Your Specter Blueprint will be awarded according to your score. More difficult missions offer stronger Specters. (One Blueprint reward per Mission.)

*Your points will then multiply according to the difficulty of the node to determine your Operation Reward:
**Easy (Vallis on Mars or Numa on Saturn) -- x1 Point Multiplier
**Medium (Brugia on Eris or Mab on Uranus) -- x2 Point Multiplier
**Hard (Nereid on Neptune or Cinxia on Ceres) –- x3 Point Multiplier
**Nightmare (if occurring) -- x4 Point Multiplier

OPERATION START AND END TIME
*Specters of Liberty is on now! This operation will end on Thursday, May 8 at 12 PM EDT.

OPERATION REWARDS - distributed as soon as you get the required points!
*The Red Veil will also recognize you for how you bring home their Operatives. They want you to send a message to the enemy.

Recognition is awarded after you reach the following point levels:
*5 points =Operation Badge
*100 points =Rakta Syandana

Go forth, Tenno and help the Red Veil bring their people home!

*New: Tenno Specters!
**Tenno, you are not alone. The power to create a Specter can now be found in your Arsenal once you obtain a Blueprint! Creating a Tenno Specter can be accomplished by Rescuing hostages in Rescue 2.0! All new Rescue missions will include a hostage whose reward is determined by the difficulty and skill in completion of the mission!
**You will be able to create the following tiers of Tenno Specters: Vapor, Phase, Force, Cosmic
**The Blueprints for these Specters can be found when Rescuing targets, see above details for the way points and difficulty works in obtaining your Blueprints!
*What can you do with these Tenno Specters?
**If you’re in a Clan or Alliance that wants to add greater challenge and defenses to your Solar Rail, you can create Tenno Specters to give to your Clan/Alliance’s Tactician to begin building an army for strategic deployment!
**If you’re a player that wants added help in your regular missions, you can bring Tenno Specters in your gear slots to deploy!
**Or, maybe you’re both! Have fun in the field with a Tenno Specter at your side!
*New Enemy Type: Wardens! These enemy types are more susceptible to stealth based attacks - find them as a part of Rescue 2.0!
*Added Fusion Core Folding! This feature will automatically group all of your Cores together by Rarity and Rank; i.e You have 50 Common Cores, 25 of which are rank 1 and 25 of which are Rank 2? They will now appear as separate stacks in your Inventory!
*Added in Melee mode functionality for when playing in Big Picture mode.
*Added support for additional aspect ratios.
*Added in support for dark energy colours.

Quick Tips:
*HOLD “F” to equip Melee.
*Go to [[Ceres]] for new [[Grineer Shipyard|Shipyards]].
*New Weapons & Warframe are here!
*Build an Orokin Research Room in Dojo to participate in the Dark Sectors.

'''Prosecutors: Gateways to Hek.'''{{clr}}
Tenno, we have received word that Vay Hek has enlisted the ranks of the Grineer Prosecutors and Guardsmen to keep the Tenno at bay.

To fight Vay Hek players must first find his location, a secret the Prosecutors protect.

HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO
*You will receive a message from the Lotus that includes a Frequency Triangulator. This gift will be essential in locating Councilor Vay Hek.
*Visit the Shipyards on Ceres. Here you must Defeat Councilor Vay Hek's Prosecutors.  Beware, Tenno! They are unlike any enemy you have fought before. Each Prosecutor is vulnerable to a primary elemental type (fire, ice, toxin or electrical damage) and you must use this to your advantage. Note that Prosecutors are not susceptible to secondary combined elemental types. For greater success, team up with other Tenno and make use of multiple elemental types.
*Some of the Prosecutors carry Locator Beacons that will drop once you have defeated them. The beacons broadcast on four channels: Frequency Delta, Frequency Gamma, Frequency Kappa and Frequency Omega. Once you have collected the required number of each, use the Frequency Triangulator to craft a key that leads to Vay Hek.
*Find Vay Hek and take him down!
Successfully defeat Councilor Vay Hek and complete the mission to receive one of these rewards:
*Hydroid Helmet Blueprint
*Hydroid Chassis Blueprint
*Hydroid Systems Blueprint
|additions      =
*New Warframe - [[Hydroid]]! A water/sea themed frame emerges from the depths. Find him in the Market today! His blueprints can be obtained from the new Vay Hek boss… once you find him.  
<gallery hideaddbutton="true" widths="640" position="center" captionposition="within">
Warframe Profile - Hydroid
</gallery>

*New Carrier Sentinel Parrot Skin & Attachments!  A perfect pairing with Hydroid!
*New Gameplay System - Melee 2.0! We have discussed and shared insight on this system overhaul over several Livestreams, and now you can play it for yourself! Main features of this overhaul include:
**A completely reanimated system for each weapon grip.
**A ‘Stance’ slot with every melee weapon, where you can equip a fighting stance.
**A combo system that increases your melee weapon’s damage the more you hit your enemy.
**A feedback system that allows for more responsive melee attacks.
**A Channeling mechanic that allows you to channel your Warframe’s energy into your melee weapon when it’s equipped!
**A fully equipped melee weapon state, hold your melee key to equip your weapon (default F)!
**There are unique combos across many different weapons, for a list of how to execute these combos, visit the Combos section of the pause menu.
*Charge attacks have been removed and replaced with Combos.
** All Charge Attack based mods have been repurposed to suit the new system. Affected mods:
***[[Reflex Coil]]
***[[Focus Energy]]
***[[Killing Blow]]
***[[Corrupt Charge]]
***[[Second Wind]]
**NOTE: Due to the changes introduced with Melee 2.0, Melee Auto Targeting is now set to ‘ON’ by default

'''Missing Mod Script:'''
The script to remedy missing mods in the past week is about to be deployed, and it involves some amendment of inventory issues overall. Read on if you were affected by this (there were 2112 cases).<br>The script is going to give players any mods they were entitled to from a mission, trade, or transmutation.<br>However, the ‘not being able to received mod’ issue also allowed players to overfuse/sell mods for credits without the mods actually disappearing from their inventory. The script has a rollback for any accounts that overfused or sold mods, with the conditions listed out below.{{clr}}
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
'''TERMINOLOGY:'''
*Raw Mod: an unranked mod that stacks with other unranked mods
*Cooked Mod: a mod that does not stack with unranked mods
'''WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ROLLBACK A TRANSACTION:'''
*Selling: credits are removed, raw and cooked mods are returned to you
*Fusion: credits are refunded, raw and cooked mods are returned to you.  Upgrade level is reverted.
*Transmutation: credits are refunded, raw mods returned.
*Trading: credits are refunded, platinum reverted, keys reverted, raw and cooked mods reverted.  (i.e. if you gave away mods, you get them back.  If you received mods, you lose them).  Your trading partner is unaffected.
'''CONDITIONS FOR TRIGGERING A ROLLBACK:'''
#if you acquired credits by selling raw mods you did not actually have, sale is rolled back.
#if you consumed raw mods you did not have in order to create a new cooked mod via fusion, the cooked mod is marked "illegally acquired".  Fusion is rolled back.
#if you traded away raw mods you did not have, any cooked mods recieved in the trade are marked as "illegally acquired".  Trade is rolled back.
#if you acquired credits by selling cooked mods that were marked "illegally acquired", sale is rolled back.
#if you consumed raw mods you did not have as part of a transmutation, transmutation is rolled back.
#if you traded away a cooked mod marked "illegally acquired", any cooked mods recieved in the trade are also marked as illegally acquired.  Trade is rolled back.
#if you consumed raw mods you did not have to perform fusion to increase the level of a cooked mod, the cooked mod is marked "illegally upgraded".  Fusion is rolled back.
#if you consumed a cooked mod marked as illegally acquired to perform fusion on a cooked mod, the mod is marked as illegally upgraded.  Fusion is rolled back.
#if you performed fusion to increase the level of a cooked mod marked as "illegally upgraded" or "illegally acquired", fusion is rolled back.
#if you consumed a cooked mod marked as illegally acquired to create a new cooked mod, the mod is marked as illegally acquired.  Fusion is rolled back.
In the case that you've already spent your ill-gotten platinum or credits, we are setting you to zero credits or platinum (instead of letting you go negative).

|title          =Tenno Reinforcements: Drakgoon
|image          =TR_Drakgoon.jpg
|additions      =
*Drakgoon Flak cannon available now!<br>Send volleys of hot shrapnel flying and dominate the enemy with the Drakgoon Flak Cannon! Fire it in wide bursts to target multiple enemies or take aim and attack with a powerful, concentrated shot.
|changes        =
*Increased stagger threshold and made stagger only occur on big hits instead of on accumulated damage; this should prevent situations where Quick Thinking would save you only to let you get knocked down and killed again.
*Changed enemy scaling for Endless Defense missions at high levels (now wave 100 enemies should be around level 200 instead of 8000).
*Removed the Candy Cane Scythe from the store.
*Improved Faction invasion momentum by periodically increasing score for leading faction by a small amount (since numerous stalemates have emerged which interfered with the flow of the system).
*Implemented Shadow Quality option for DirectX 11; also made it apply in places it did not previously. Changing this option now takes effect immediately (ie: no game restart required).
*Made all Warframe components sellable ({{cc|1000}} each).
*Changed Lotus transmissions to reduce chatter: added delay to Mobile Defense reminders, Heavy Unit transmissions now have a 2 minute cool-down and can occur at most 3 times per mission.
*Loki’s Invisibility no longer reduces the volume of dialog and music.
*Changed logic that determines visual representation of damage mods on continuous-fire weapons (eg: Synapse, Ignis, etc).<br>The frequency of damage numbers used to be limited by using a minimum damage threshold. Since damage mods increase the rate at which damage accumulates, this would cause damage to be inflicted more often though each damage event would not necessarily be larger. This led to people thinking the mods did nothing because they didn't notice the increased rate at which numbers would appear (an easy mistake for low level damage mods). Similarly, headshots would make numbers appear more often but not necessarily create bigger numbers.<br>Now continuous fire weapons now limit the frequency of damage numbers by using a minimum time between impacts, regardless of how much damage has accumulated. This gives us a lot more control and should make things more obvious for players who are applying damage mods (it's easier to notice that numbers are 5% larger in magnitude vs being generated 5% faster)
|fixes          =
*Fixed issue with going past Wave 100 in Endless Defense resetting enemy levels and interfering with spawning.
*Fixed another potential cause of the Fog Epidemic of 2013 and 2014.
*Fixed Unranked mods not being tradable.
*Fixed Platinum earned through trading not being usable in Dojo.
*Fixed kills made with Ember’s Fire Blast not always counting towards your stats.
*Fixed Clients seeing gore when they have the gore turned off.
*Fixed Penta energy colour not always applying to grenades.
*Fixed issue with Rank 3 Weapon Mastery Challenge/Achievement not being updated immediately.
*Fixed enemy warning transmissions playing when spawning turrets & cameras (the Lotus would say “Robots approaching!” when it was just cameras).
*Fixed excessive footstep sounds in cases where animation had to catch up with movement.
*Fixed issue in dojo where a player on the kneeling pad could slide off and be unable to stand up.
*Fixed fire-rate stats in the arsenal for continuous fire-weapons so you can correctly interpret the magazine size.
*Fixed issue with Volt being unable to melee if Overload was active or lingering.
*Fixed issue with Reactor Room door floating in dojo.
*Fixed issue with Polish translation of “Continue” and German text on Mercury overlapping UI.
*Fixed game crash when rebinding controls.
*Fixed Dojo crash related to large dojo’s building an elevator late in the dojo’s progress.
*Fixed crash caused by change in audio device.
*Fixed various crashes.

**Valkyr:
***Paralysis (Third Power) - Now only takes 1/3rd of shields but still calculates damage based on 1/2 shield use.
***Hysteria (Fourth Power) - Now has life regain/regeneration as damage is being dealt to enemies.
**Ember:
***Fireball (First Power) - Deals Direct damage with a 100% Fire proc, on impact deals radial damage with 50% Fire Proc, has a faster travel time.
***Accelerant (New Second Power - was Overheat) - Accelerant affects all enemies in a radius to have knockback + it coats them in fire damage amplifier!
***Fire Blast - Initial radial damage now has 100% fire proc.
**Saryn:
***Venom - Now does viral damage.
***Molt – The Molt Decoy now gets increased health with fusion level.
***Miasma - Damage increase and changed to corrosive damage type.
*The Void’s influence is still strong on the Orokin Derelicts –  and some Prime items have a new home. You can now search Orokin Derelict Defenses for the Sicarus Prime Blueprint, Ember Prime Blueprint, and Boar Prime Receiver!
*Corpus Gas City Expansion.
*Infested Invasion missions now only require 3 completions for Battle Pay instead of 5.
*Infested Invasions will always inherit node mission type if the preexisting node was: Exterminate, Defense, Mobile Defense, or Survival. If the node being Infested was not one of those, game will decide randomly out of the 4 (Exterm, Defense, M. Defense, Survival).
*Increase limit on the number of rooms allowed in your Dojo. The limit is now 100 rooms!
*Trinity’s Blueprint drops have moved to Iliad on Phobos to be dropped by Kril and Vor!
*Armour/Shield/Health/Damage curves have been modified. We’ve lowered the “bullet sponge” to high level enemies, but they now deal more damage. The armour curve was radically dropped. The health and shields curves dropped slightly as well. However, damage output went up.
*Adjustments to enemies targeting when using melee attacks – they go for you now, not the camera!
*Adjustments to frequency of Lotus dialogue.
*All Sentinel Weapons now respond to fire-rate mods, magazine-size mods, and reload-time mods.
*Host election made a little bit more robust (corner cases, like interrupting election just before level starts, then restarting lobby etc)
*Changes to weapon projectile logic. The motivation of this change is that we want weapons like grenades that explode to end up in the same spot on host and client (in sync) without having the traditional delay of a replicated projectile (in particular, we have grenades that can be remotely detonated and this requires more or less precise timing on the part of the local client). This should fix some random self-inflicted deaths!

*Fixed texture issues, seen here: [https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/149613-missing-texture-or-something-along-those-lines-on-phobos/]

**Amount of deployable drones varies – you get one for every five mastery ranks.
***Mastery 0 – 4, 1 drone
***Master 5- 9, 2 drones
***Master 10 +,  3 drones.   
**All Founders/Primes Access get +1 to each tier. So if you are Mastery 14 and Founder, you get 4. If Mastery 14 and no Founder status, you get 3.

*Tenno Reinforcement: The Penta! A Corpus Grenade Launcher enters the Tenno Arsenal!

'''Systemic Invasions 1.0 is live!'''

*Grineer & Corpus now periodically attack star chart nodes owned by opposing factions; if successful, battlefront moves to an adjacent node, otherwise faction "rests" before attacking another node.
*The Infested now truly infest! The faction has vacated the Star Chart and now exists as an Invasion faction! Keep your eyes peeled for signs of Infested threats – they’ll strike hard.
*Infestation "outbreaks" will occur at random, with a downtime of 12 – 36 hours between attacks. When a node is under Infested threat, battlefront aggressively moves to all adjacent nodes if invasion isn't successfully defended within a matter of hours. Outbreaks continue to spread until reaching a boss node, which leads to Phorid appearing and occupying that boss's node until the invasion is defeated!
*This system is a new dynamic we’re trying out and will be standing by for feedback/suggestions accordingly.
|changes        =
*Weapon changes:
**Buffed Grakata - Higher Proc/Crit chance. Higher damage (9 to 11)
**Buffed Boltor - Projectile flies faster, Upped damage (18 - 25), Higher Crit chance
**Buffed Bolto, Slightly more damage, more crit, projectile speed increase
**Damage and range buff for Tigris - 35-45 per pellet, firing mechanic has pretty hard draw back. - so this thing needs to hit like a truck! (Scott’s Words!)
**Lanka, puncture by default (5m)
**Weak Energy projectile for Lanka, you can now shoot before weapon is fully charged (although a weaker shot).
**Magnum reload time tweak.
**Heat Dagger and Dual Heat Swords now deal Fire damage with Charge Attacks and Ground Slams
**Amphis now deals Electricity damage on Ground Slams
*Changes to Sentinel XP distribution:
**Based on reports and experiences with slow-ranking Sentinels, we have changed the way Experience is distributed amongst your feisty friends.
*Previously:
**Sentinel kills would split experience between your Sentinel’s weapon and your Warframe, so your Sentinel itself would miss out on experience.
**Weapon kills would split evenly between your Warframe and your Weapon (50% each), then a 42% bonus chunk of experience would be given to the Sentinel and its weapon (21% each). Note that the total XP earned was 142% of what you saw on the screen – now it will be 200%.
*Now:
**Regular weapon kills divide experience evenly between your weapon and your Warframe (50% each).
**Kills using a Warframe ability give all the experience to the Warframe (as before).
**Sentinel weapon kills divide experience evenly between your Sentinel and its weapon (50% each).
**Kills using a precept give all the experience to your Sentinel (as before).
**Experience from other players (shared experience) is split evenly amongst your gear as follows: a quarter goes to your Warframe and a quarter goes to each of your weapons (25% each). If you have a sentinel equipped, a 100% bonus chunk of experience is split evenly between your Sentinel and its weapon (50% each).
*Clan Trading Tax option is live! For more information, see their [https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/132826-trading-guidefaq FAQ]
*Dojo flags now show Clan emblem
*All enemy resistances have been expanded. More resistance types have been added with a redistribution of damage types among enemies.
*Lotus 2.0! Lotus has recently had a major overhaul. Most of her lines have been re-recorded and now sound more consistent across the entire game. Lotus now uses a brand new DSP system to playback her audio files. Her voice has a more dynamic sound that makes use of some digital audio randomization so her voice effect will sound slightly different every time it plays.
*Changed Capture targets voices. There are now 2 different voices for each of the Corpus and Grineer factions. They now speak as you chase them/capture them.
*Elemental procs now also deal damage scaled to the weapon you are using.
*Conclave values added for Bane of Corpus, Bane of Grineer, Band of Infested, Expel Corpus, Expel Grineer, Expel Infested, Smite Corpus, Smite Grineer, Smite Infested
